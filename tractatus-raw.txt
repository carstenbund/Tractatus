1 The world is everything that is the case.*
1.1 1.11 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the
facts.
For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.
1.13 1.2 The facts in logical space are the world.
The world divides into facts.
Any one can either be the case or not be the case, and everything else remain the same.
2 What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.
2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).
2.011 It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent part of an atomic fact.
2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in an atomic fact the possibility of that atomic fact must already be prejudged in the thing.
2.0121 It would, so to speak, appear as an accident, when to a thing that could exist alone on its own account, subsequently a state of aairs could be made to t.
If things can occur in atomic facts, this possibility must al- ready lie in them.
*The decimal gures as numbers of the separate propositions indicate the logical
importance of the propositions, the emphasis laid upon them in my exposition. The
propositions n.1, n.2, n.3, etc., are comments on proposition No. n; the propositions
n.m1, n.m2, etc., are comments on the proposition No. n.m; and so on.

TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
(A logical entity cannot be merely possible. Logic treats of every possibility, and all possibilities are its facts.)
Just as we cannot think of spatial objects at all apart from space, or temporal objects apart from time, so we cannot think of any object apart from the possibility of its connexion with other things.
If I can think of an object in the context of an atomic fact, I cannot think of it apart from the possibility of this context.
2.0122 The thing is independent, in so far as it can occur in all pos-
sible circumstances, but this form of independence is a form of connexion with the atomic fact, a form of dependence. (It is impossible for words to occur in two dierent ways, alone and in the proposition.)
2.0123 If I know an object, then I also know all the possibilities of its occurrence in atomic facts.
(Every such possibility must lie in the nature of the object.)
A new possibility cannot subsequently be found.
2.01231 In order to know an object, I must know not its external but all its internal qualities.
2.0124 If all objects are given, then thereby are all possible atomic facts
also given.
2.013 Every thing is, as it were, in a space of possible atomic facts. I can think of this space as empty, but not of the thing without the space.
2.0131 A spatial object must lie in innite space. (A point in space is a place for an argument.)
A speck in a visual eld need not be red, but it must have a colour; it has, so to speak, a colour space round it. A tone must have a pitch, the object of the sense of touch a hardness, etc.
2.014 Objects contain the possibility of all states of aairs.
2.0141 The possibility of its occurrence in atomic facts is the form of the object.
2.02 The object is simple.
2.0201 Every statement about complexes can be analysed into a state-
26
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
ment about their constituent parts, and into those propositions which completely describe the complexes.
2.021 Objects form the substance of the world. Therefore they cannot be compound.
2.0211 If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition had sense would depend on whether another proposition was true.
2.0212 It would then be impossible to form a picture of the world (true or false).
2.022 It is clear that however dierent from the real one an imagined world may be, it must have somethinga formin common with the real world.
2.023 This xed form consists of the objects.
2.0231 The substance of the world can only determine a form and not any material properties. For these are rst presented by the propositionsrst formed by the conguration of the objects.
2.0232 Roughly speaking: objects are colourless.
2.0233 Two objects of the same logical form areapart from their ex- ternal propertiesonly dierentiated from one another in that they are dierent.
2.02331 Either a thing has properties which no other has, and then one can distinguish it straight away from the others by a description and refer to it; or, on the other hand, there are several things which have the totality of their properties in common, and then it is quite impossible to point to any one of them.
For if a thing is not distinguished by anything, I cannot dis- tinguish itfor otherwise it would be distinguished.
2.024 Substance is what exists independently of what is the case.
2.025 It is form and content.
2.0251 Space, time and colour (colouredness) are forms of objects.
2.026 Only if there are objects can there be a xed form of the world.
2.027 The xed, the existent and the object are one.
2.0271 The object is the xed, the existent; the conguration is the changing, the variable.
27
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
2.0272 The conguration of the objects forms the atomic fact.
2.03 In the atomic fact objects hang one in another, like the members of a chain.
2.031 In the atomic fact the objects are combined in a denite way.
2.032 The way in which objects hang together in the atomic fact is the structure of the atomic fact.
2.033 The form is the possibility of the structure.
2.034 The structure of the fact consists of the structures of the atomic facts.
2.04 The totality of existent atomic facts is the world.
2.05 The totality of existent atomic facts also determines which atom- ic facts do not exist.
2.06 The existence and non-existence of atomic facts is the reality.
(The existence of atomic facts we also call a positive fact, their non-existence a negative fact.)
2.061 Atomic facts are independent of one another.
2.062 From the existence or non-existence of an atomic fact we cannot infer the existence or non-existence of another.
2.063 The total reality is the world.
2.1 We make to ourselves pictures of facts.
2.11 The picture presents the facts in logical space, the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.
2.12 The picture is a model of reality.
2.13 To the objects correspond in the picture the elements of the picture.
2.131 The elements of the picture stand, in the picture, for the objects.
2.14 The picture consists in the fact that its elements are combined with one another in a denite way.
2.141 The picture is a fact.
2.15 That the elements of the picture are combined with one another in a denite way, represents that the things are so combined with one another.
28
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
This connexion of the elements of the picture is called its structure, and the possibility of this structure is called the form of representation of the picture.
2.151 The form of representation is the possibility that the things are combined with one another as are the elements of the picture.
2.1511 Thus the picture is linked with reality; it reaches up to it.
2.1512 It is like a scale applied to reality.
2.15121 Only the outermost points of the dividing lines touch the object
to be measured.
2.1513 According to this view the representing relation which makes it a picture, also belongs to the picture.
2.1514 The representing relation consists of the co-ordinations of the elements of the picture and the things.
2.1515 These co-ordinations are as it were the feelers of its elements with which the picture touches reality.
2.16 In order to be a picture a fact must have something in common with what it pictures.
2.161 In the picture and the pictured there must be something identi- cal in order that the one can be a picture of the other at all.
2.17 What the picture must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it after its mannerrightly or falselyis its form of representation.
2.171 The picture can represent every reality whose form it has.
The spatial picture, everything spatial, the coloured, every- thing coloured, etc.
2.172 The picture, however, cannot represent its form of representa- tion; it shows it forth.
2.173 The picture represents its object from without (its standpoint is its form of representation), therefore the picture represents its object rightly or falsely.
2.174 But the picture cannot place itself outside of its form of repre- sentation.
2.18 What every picture, of whatever form, must have in common
29
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
with reality in order to be able to represent it at allrightly or falselyis the logical form, that is, the form of reality.
2.181 If the form of representation is the logical form, then the picture is called a logical picture.
2.182 Every picture is also a logical picture. (On the other hand, for example, not every picture is spatial.)
2.19 The logical picture can depict the world.
2.2 The picture has the logical form of representation in common with what it pictures.
2.201 The picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.
2.202 The picture represents a possible state of aairs in logical space.
2.203 The picture contains the possibility of the state of aairs which it represents.
2.21 The picture agrees with reality or not; it is right or wrong, true or false.
2.22 The picture represents what it represents, independently of its truth or falsehood, through the form of representation.
2.221 What the picture represents is its sense.
2.222 In the agreement or disagreement of its sense with reality, its truth or falsity consists.
2.223 In order to discover whether the picture is true or false we must compare it with reality.
2.224 It cannot be discovered from the picture alone whether it is true or false.
2.225 There is no picture which is a priori true.
3 The logical picture of the facts is the thought.
3.001 An atomic fact is thinkablemeans: we can imagine it.
3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.
3.02 The thought contains the possibility of the state of aairs which it thinks.
What is thinkable is also possible.
30
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
3.03 We cannot think anything unlogical, for otherwise we should have to think unlogically.
3.031 It used to be said that God could create everything, except what was contrary to the laws of logic. The truth is, we could not say
of an unlogical world how it would look.
3.032 To present in language anything which contradicts logic is as impossible as in geometry to present by its co-ordinates a gure which contradicts the laws of space; or to give the co-ordinates of a point which does not exist.
3.0321 We could present spatially an atomic fact which contradicted the laws of physics, but not one which contradicted the laws of geometry.
3.04 An a priori true thought would be one whose possibility guar- anteed its truth.
3.05 We could only know a priori that a thought is true if its truth was to be recognized from the thought itself (without an object of comparison).
3.1 In the proposition the thought is expressed perceptibly through the senses.
3.11 We use the sensibly perceptible sign (sound or written sign, etc.) of the proposition as a projection of the possible state of aairs.
The method of projection is the thinking of the sense of the proposition.
3.12 The sign through which we express the thought I call the prop- ositional sign. And the proposition is the propositional sign in its projective relation to the world.
3.13 To the proposition belongs everything which belongs to the pro- jection; but not what is projected.
Therefore the possibility of what is projected but not this itself.
In the proposition, therefore, its sense is not yet contained, but the possibility of expressing it.
(The content of the proposition means the content of the signicant proposition.)
In the proposition the form of its sense is contained, but not its content.
31
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
3.14 The propositional sign consists in the fact that its elements, the words, are combined in it in a denite way.
The propositional sign is a fact.
3.141 The proposition is not a mixture of words (just as the musical theme is not a mixture of tones).
The proposition is articulate.
3.142 Only facts can express a sense, a class of names cannot.
3.143 That the propositional sign is a fact is concealed by the ordinary form of expression, written or printed.
(For in the printed proposition, for example, the sign of a proposition does not appear essentially dierent from a word. Thus it was possible for Frege to call the proposition a com- pounded name.)
3.1431 The essential nature of the propositional sign becomes very clear when we imagine it made up of spatial objects (such as tables, chairs, books) instead of written signs.
The mutual spatial position of these things then expresses the sense of the proposition.
3.1432 We must not say, The complex sign `aRb' says `a stands in
relation R to b'; but we must say, That `a' stands in a certain
relation to `b' says that aRb.
3.144 States of aairs can be described but not named.
(Names resemble points; propositions resemble arrows, they have sense.)
3.2 In propositions thoughts can be so expressed that to the objects of the thoughts correspond the elements of the propositional sign.
3.201 These elements I call simple signs and the proposition com- pletely analysed.
3.202 The simple signs employed in propositions are called names.
3.203 The name means the object. The object is its meaning. (A is
the same sign as A.)
3.21 To the conguration of the simple signs in the propositional sign corresponds the conguration of the objects in the state of aairs.
32
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
3.22 3.221 In the proposition the name represents the object.
Objects I can only name. Signs represent them. I can only speak
of them. I cannot assert them. A proposition can only say how
a thing is, not what it is.
3.23 The postulate of the possibility of the simple signs is the postu- late of the determinateness of the sense.
3.24 A proposition about a complex stands in internal relation to the proposition about its constituent part.
A complex can only be given by its description, and this will either be right or wrong. The proposition in which there is mention of a complex, if this does not exist, becomes not nonsense but simply false.
That a propositional element signies a complex can be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositions in which it oc- curs. We know that everything is not yet determined by this proposition. (The notation for generality contains a prototype.)
The combination of the symbols of a complex in a simple symbol can be expressed by a denition.
3.25 There is one and only one complete analysis of the proposition.
3.251 The proposition expresses what it expresses in a denite and clearly speciable way: the proposition is articulate.
3.26 The name cannot be analysed further by any denition. It is a primitive sign.
3.261 Every dened sign signies via those signs by which it is dened, and the denitions show the way.
Two signs, one a primitive sign, and one dened by primitive signs, cannot signify in the same way. Names cannot be taken to pieces by denition (nor any sign which alone and independently has a meaning).
3.262 What does not get expressed in the sign is shown by its appli- cation. What the signs conceal, their application declares.
3.263 The meanings of primitive signs can be explained by elucida- tions. Elucidations are propositions which contain the primitive signs. They can, therefore, only be understood when the mean- ings of these signs are already known.
33
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
3.3 Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of a propo- sition has a name meaning.
3.31 Every part of a proposition which characterizes its sense I call an expression (a symbol).
(The proposition itself is an expression.)
Expressions are everythingessential for the sense of the propositionthat propositions can have in common with one another.
An expression characterizes a form and a content.
3.311 An expression presupposes the forms of all propositions in which it can occur. It is the common characteristic mark of a class of propositions.
3.312 It is therefore represented by the general form of the propositions which it characterizes.
And in this form the expression is constant and everything
else variable.
3.313 An expression is thus presented by a variable, whose values are the propositions which contain the expression.
(In the limiting case the variables become constants, the ex- pression a proposition.)
I call such a variable a propositional variable.
3.314 An expression has meaning only in a proposition. Every variable can be conceived as a propositional variable.
(Including the variable name.)
3.315 If we change a constituent part of a proposition into a variable, there is a class of propositions which are all the values of the re- sulting variable proposition. This class in general still depends on what, by arbitrary agreement, we mean by parts of that prop- osition. But if we change all those signs, whose meaning was ar- bitrarily determined, into variables, there always remains such a class. But this is now no longer dependent on any agreement; it depends only on the nature of the proposition. It corresponds to a logical form, to a logical prototype.
3.316 What values the propositional variable can assume is deter- mined.
34
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
The determination of the values is the variable.
3.317 The determination of the values of the propositional variable is done by indicating the propositions whose common mark the
variable is.
The determination is a description of these propositions.
The determination will therefore deal only with symbols not with their meaning.
And only this is essential to the determination, that it is
only a description of symbols and asserts nothing about what is
symbolized.
The way in which we describe the propositions is not essen- tial.
3.318 I conceive the propositionlike Frege and Russellas a function of the expressions contained in it.
3.32 The sign is the part of the symbol perceptible by the senses.
3.321 Two dierent symbols can therefore have the sign (the written sign or the sound sign) in commonthey then signify in dierent ways.
3.322 It can never indicate the common characteristic of two objects that we symbolize them with the same signs but by dierent
methods of symbolizing. For the sign is arbitrary. We could therefore equally well choose two dierent signs and where then would be what was common in the symbolization.
3.323 In the language of everyday life it very often happens that the same word signies in two dierent waysand therefore belongs to two dierent symbolsor that two words, which signify in dierent ways, are apparently applied in the same way in the proposition.
Thus the word is appears as the copula, as the sign of equality, and as the expression of existence; to exist as an intransitive verb like to go; identical as an adjective; we speak of something but also of the fact of something happening.
(In the proposition Green is greenwhere the rst word is a proper name and the last an adjectivethese words have not merely dierent meanings but they are dierent symbols.)
35
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
3.324 Thus there easily arise the most fundamental confusions (of which the whole of philosophy is full).
3.325 In order to avoid these errors, we must employ a symbolism which excludes them, by not applying the same sign in dierent symbols and by not applying signs in the same way which signify in dierent ways. A symbolism, that is to say, which obeys the rules of logical grammarof logical syntax.
(The logical symbolism of Frege and Russell is such a lan- guage, which, however, does still not exclude all errors.)
3.326 In order to recognize the symbol in the sign we must consider the signicant use.
3.327 The sign determines a logical form only together with its logical syntactic application.
3.328 If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless. That is the
meaning of Occam's razor.
(If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning.)
3.33 In logical syntax the meaning of a sign ought never to play a rôle; it must admit of being established without mention being thereby made of the meaning of a sign; it ought to presuppose
only the description of the expressions.
3.331 From this observation we get a further viewinto Russell's The-
ory of Types. Russell's error is shown by the fact that in drawing up his symbolic rules he has to speak of the meaning of the signs.
3.332 No proposition can say anything about itself, because the prop- ositional sign cannot be contained in itself (that is the whole theory of types).
3.333 A function cannot be its own argument, because the functional sign already contains the prototype of its own argument and it cannot contain itself.
If, for example, we suppose that the function F(fx) could be its own argument, then there would be a proposition
F(F(fx)), and in this the outer function F and the inner
function F must have dierent meanings; for the inner has
the form ϕ(fx), the outer the form ψ(ϕ(fx)). Common to
36
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
both functions is only the letter F, which by itself signies
nothing.
This is at once clear, if instead of F(F(u)) we write (∃ϕ) :
F(ϕu) .ϕu= Fu.
Herewith Russell's paradox vanishes.
3.334 The rules of logical syntax must follow of themselves, if we only know how every single sign signies.
3.34 A proposition possesses essential and accidental features.
Accidental are the features which are due to a particular way of producing the propositional sign. Essential are those which alone enable the proposition to express its sense.
3.341 The essential in a proposition is therefore that which is common to all propositions which can express the same sense.
And in the same way in general the essential in a symbol is that which all symbols which can full the same purpose have in common.
3.3411 One could therefore say the real name is that which all symbols, which signify an object, have in common. It would then follow, step by step, that no sort of composition was essential for a name.
3.342 In our notations there is indeed something arbitrary, but this
is not arbitrary, namely that if we have determined anything
arbitrarily, then something else must be the case. (This results
from the essence of the notation.)
3.3421 A particular method of symbolizing may be unimportant, but it is always important that this is a possible method of symboliz- ing. And this happens as a rule in philosophy: The single thing proves over and over again to be unimportant, but the possibil- ity of every single thing reveals something about the nature of the world.
3.343 Denitions are rules for the translation of one language into another. Every correct symbolism must be translatable into every other according to such rules. It is this which all have in
common.
37
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
3.344 What signies in the symbol is what is common to all those symbols by which it can be replaced according to the rules of logical syntax.
3.3441 We can, for example, express what is common to all notations for the truth-functions as follows: It is common to them that they all, for example, can be replaced by the notations of ∼p
(not p) and p∨q (p or q).
(Herewith is indicated the way in which a special possible notation can give us general information.)
3.3442 The sign of the complex is not arbitrarily resolved in the analysis, in such a way that its resolution would be dierent in every propositional structure.
3.4 The proposition determines a place in logical space: the exis- tence of this logical place is guaranteed by the existence of the constituent parts alone, by the existence of the signicant prop- osition.
3.41 The propositional sign and the logical co-ordinates: that is the logical place.
3.411 The geometrical and the logical place agree in that each is the possibility of an existence.
3.42 Although a proposition may only determine one place in logical space, the whole logical space must already be given by it.
(Otherwise denial, the logical sum, the logical product, etc., would always introduce new elementsin co-ordination.)
(The logical scaolding round the picture determines the log- ical space. The proposition reaches through the whole logical space.)
3.5 The applied, thought, propositional sign is the thought.
4 The thought is the signicant proposition.
4.001 The totality of propositions is the language.
4.002 Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which every sense can be expressed, without having an idea how and what each word meansjust as one speaks without knowing how the single sounds are produced.
38
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
Colloquial language is a part of the human organism and is not less complicated than it.
From it it is humanly impossible to gather immediately the logic of language.
Language disguises the thought; so that from the external form of the clothes one cannot infer the form of the thought they clothe, because the external form of the clothes is constructed with quite another object than to let the form of the body be recognized.
The silent adjustments to understand colloquial language are enormously complicated.
4.003 Most propositions and questions, that have been written about philosophical matters, are not false, but senseless. We can- not, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language.
(They are of the same kind as the question whether the Good is more or less identical than the Beautiful.)
And so it is not to be wondered at that the deepest problems are really no problems.
4.0031 All philosophy is Critique of language (but not at all in Mauth- ner's sense). Russell's merit is to have shown that the apparent logical form of the proposition need not be its real form.
4.01 The proposition is a picture of reality.
The proposition is a model of the reality as we think it is.
4.011 At the rst glance the propositionsay as it stands printed on paperdoes not seem to be a picture of the reality of which it treats. But nor does the musical score appear at rst sight to be a picture of a musical piece; nor does our phonetic spelling (letters) seem to be a picture of our spoken language. And yet these symbolisms prove to be pictureseven in the ordinary sense of the wordof what they represent.
4.012 It is obvious that we perceive a proposition of the form aRb as a picture. Here the sign is obviously a likeness of the signied.
4.013 And if we penetrate to the essence of this pictorial nature we
39
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
see that this is not disturbed by apparent irregularities (like the
use of ♯ and ♭ in the score).
For these irregularities also picture what they are to express; only in another way.
4.014 The gramophone record, the musical thought, the score, the waves of sound, all stand to one another in that pictorial internal relation, which holds between language and the world. To all of them the logical structure is common.
(Like the two youths, their two horses and their lilies in the story. They are all in a certain sense one.)
4.0141 In the fact that there is a general rule by which the musician is able to read the symphony out of the score, and that there is a rule by which one could reconstruct the symphony from the line on a gramophone record and from this againby means of the rst ruleconstruct the score, herein lies the internal similarity between these things which at rst sight seem to be entirely dierent. And the rule is the law of projection which projects the symphony into the language of the musical score. It is the rule of translation of this language into the language of the gramophone record.
4.015 The possibility of all similes, of all the imagery of our language, rests on the logic of representation.
4.016 In order to understand the essence of the proposition, consider hieroglyphic writing, which pictures the facts it describes.
And from it came the alphabet without the essence of the representation being lost.
4.02 This we see from the fact that we understand the sense of the propositional sign, without having had it explained to us.
4.021 The proposition is a picture of reality, for I know the state of aairs presented by it, if I understand the proposition. And I understand the proposition, without its sense having been ex- plained to me.
4.022 The proposition shows its sense.
The proposition shows how things stand, if it is true. And
it says, that they do so stand.
40
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
4.023 The proposition determines reality to this extent, that one only needs to say Yes or No to it to make it agree with reality.
It must therefore be completely described by the proposition.
A proposition is the description of a fact.
As the description of an object describes it by its external properties so propositions describe reality by its internal prop- erties.
The proposition constructs a world with the help of a logical scaolding, and therefore one can actually see in the proposition all the logical features possessed by reality if it is true. One can
draw conclusions from a false proposition.
4.024 To understand a proposition means to know what is the case, if it is true.
(One can therefore understand it without knowing whether it is true or not.)
One understands it if one understands its constituent parts.
4.025 The translation of one language into another is not a process of translating each proposition of the one into a proposition of the other, but only the constituent parts of propositions are translated.
(And the dictionary does not only translate substantives but also adverbs and conjunctions, etc., and it treats them all alike.)
4.026 The meanings of the simple signs (the words) must be explained to us, if we are to understand them.
By means of propositions we explain ourselves.
4.027 It is essential to propositions, that they can communicate a new
sense to us.
4.03 A proposition must communicate a new sense with old words.
The proposition communicates to us a state of aairs, there- fore it must be essentially connected with the state of aairs.
And the connexion is, in fact, that it is its logical picture.
The proposition only asserts something, in so far as it is a picture.
4.031 In the proposition a state of aairs is, as it were, put together for the sake of experiment.
41
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
One can say, instead of, This proposition has such and such a sense, This proposition represents such and such a state of aairs.
4.0311 One name stands for one thing, and another for another thing, and they are connected together. And so the whole, like a living picture, presents the atomic fact.
4.0312 The possibility of propositions is based upon the principle of the representation of objects by signs.
My fundamental thought is that the logical constants do not represent. That the logic of the facts cannot be represented.
4.032 The proposition is a picture of its state of aairs, only in so far as it is logically articulated.
(Even the proposition ambulo is composite, for its stem gives a dierent sense with another termination, or its termina- tion with another stem.)
4.04 In the proposition there must be exactly as many things distin- guishable as there are in the state of aairs, which it represents.
They must both possess the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity (cf. Hertz's Mechanics, on Dynamic Models).
4.041 This mathematical multiplicity naturally cannot in its turn be represented. One cannot get outside it in the representation.
4.0411 If we tried, for example, to express what is expressed by (x).fx
by putting an index before fx, like: Gen. fx, it would not do, we should not know what was generalized. If we tried to show it by an index g, like: f(xg) it would not dowe should not know the scope of the generalization.
If we were to try it by introducing a mark in the argument places, like (G,G) .F(G,G), it would not dowe could not determine the identity of the variables, etc.
All these ways of symbolizing are inadequate because they have not the necessary mathematical multiplicity.
4.0412 For the same reason the idealist explanation of the seeing of spa- tial relations through spatial spectacles does not do, because it cannot explain the multiplicity of these relations.
4.05 Reality is compared with the proposition.
42
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
4.06 Propositions can be true or false only by being pictures of the reality.
4.061 If one does not observe that propositions have a sense inde- pendent of the facts, one can easily believe that true and false are two relations between signs and things signied with equal rights.
One could then, for example, say that p signies in the true
way what ∼p signies in the false way, etc.
4.062 Can we not make ourselves understood by means of false propo- sitions as hitherto with true ones, so long as we know that they are meant to be false? No! For a proposition is true, if what we assert by means of it is the case; and if by p we mean ∼p,
and what we mean is the case, then p in the new conception
is true and not false.
4.0621 That, however, the signs p and ∼p can say the same thing is
important, for it shows that the sign ∼ corresponds to nothing
in reality.
That negation occurs in a proposition, is no characteristic of its sense (∼∼p= p).
The propositions p and ∼p have opposite senses, but to them corresponds one and the same reality.
4.063 An illustration to explain the concept of truth. A black spot on white paper; the form of the spot can be described by saying of each point of the plane whether it is white or black. To the fact that a point is black corresponds a positive fact; to the fact that a point is white (not black), a negative fact. If I indicate a point of the plane (a truth-value in Frege's terminology), this corresponds to the assumption proposed for judgment, etc. etc.
But to be able to say that a point is black or white, I must rst know under what conditions a point is called white or black; in order to be able to say p is true (or false) I must have determined under what conditions I call p true, and thereby I
determine the sense of the proposition.
The point at which the simile breaks down is this: we can indicate a point on the paper, without knowing what white and black are; but to a proposition without a sense corresponds noth- ing at all, for it signies no thing (truth-value) whose properties
43
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
are called false or true; the verb of the proposition is not is true or is falseas Frege thoughtbut that which is true must already contain the verb.
4.064 Every proposition must already have a sense; assertion cannot give it a sense, for what it asserts is the sense itself. And the same holds of denial, etc.
4.0641 One could say, the denial is already related to the logical place determined by the proposition that is denied.
The denying proposition determines a logical place other
than does the proposition denied.
The denying proposition determines a logical place, with the help of the logical place of the proposition denied, by saying that it lies outside the latter place.
That one can deny again the denied proposition, shows that what is denied is already a proposition and not merely the pre- liminary to a proposition.
4.1 A proposition presents the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.
4.11 The totality of true propositions is the total natural science (or the totality of the natural sciences).
4.111 Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences.
(The word philosophy must mean something which stands above or below, but not beside the natural sciences.)
4.112 The object of philosophy is the logical clarication of thoughts.
Philosophy is not a theory but an activity.
A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations.
The result of philosophy is not a number of philosophical propositions, but to make propositions clear.
Philosophy should make clear and delimit sharply the thoughts which otherwise are, as it were, opaque and blurred.
4.1121 Psychology is no nearer related to philosophy, than is any other natural science.
The theory of knowledge is the philosophy of psychology.
Does not my study of sign-language correspond to the study of thought processes which philosophers held to be so essential
44
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
to the philosophy of logic? Only they got entangled for the most part in unessential psychological investigations, and there is an analogous danger for my method.
4.1122 The Darwinian theory has no more to do with philosophy than has any other hypothesis of natural science.
4.113 Philosophy limits the disputable sphere of natural science.
4.114 It should limit the thinkable and thereby the unthinkable.
It should limit the unthinkable from within through the thinkable.
4.115 It will mean the unspeakable by clearly displaying the speakable.
4.116 Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly. Everything that can be said can be said clearly.
4.12 Propositions can represent the whole reality, but they cannot represent what they must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent itthe logical form.
To be able to represent the logical form, we should have to be able to put ourselves with the propositions outside logic, that is outside the world.
4.121 Propositions cannot represent the logical form: this mirrors itself in the propositions.
That which mirrors itself in language, language cannot rep- resent.
That which expresses itself in language, we cannot express
by language.
The propositions show the logical form of reality.
They exhibit it.
4.1211 Thus a proposition fa shows that in its sense the object a
occurs, two propositions fa and ga that they are both about
the same object.
If two propositions contradict one another, this is shown by their structure; similarly if one follows from another, etc.
4.1212 What can be shown cannot be said.
4.1213 Now we understand our feeling that we are in possession of the right logical conception, if only all is right in our symbolism.
45
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
4.122 We can speak in a certain sense of formal properties of objects and atomic facts, or of properties of the structure of facts, and in the same sense of formal relations and relations of structures.
(Instead of property of the structure I also say internal prop- erty; instead of relation of structures internal relation.
I introduce these expressions in order to show the reason for the confusion, very widespread among philosophers, between internal relations and proper (external) relations.)
The holding of such internal properties and relations cannot, however, be asserted by propositions, but it shows itself in the propositions, which present the atomic facts and treat of the objects in question.
4.1221 An internal property of a fact we also call a feature of this fact. (In the sense in which we speak of facial features.)
4.123 A property is internal if it is unthinkable that its object does not possess it.
(This blue colour and that stand in the internal relation of brighter and darker eo ipso. It is unthinkable that these two
objects should not stand in this relation.)
(Here to the shifting use of the words property and rela- tion there corresponds the shifting use of the word object.)
4.124 The existence of an internal property of a possible state of aairs is not expressed by a proposition, but it expresses itself in the proposition which presents that state of aairs, by an internal property of this proposition.
It would be as senseless to ascribe a formal property to a proposition as to deny it the formal property.
4.1241 One cannot distinguish forms from one another by saying that one has this property but the other that: for this assumes that there is a sense in asserting either property of either form.
4.125 The existence of an internal relation between possible states of aairs expresses itself in language by an internal relation be- tween the propositions presenting them.
4.1251 Here the disputed question whether all relations are internal or external disappears.
46
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
4.1252 Series which are ordered by internal relations I call formal series.
The series of numbers is ordered not by an external, but by an internal relation.
Similarly the series of propositions aRb,
“(∃x) : aRx.xRb,
“(∃x,y) : aRx.aRy.yRb, etc.
(If bstands in one of these relations to a, I call ba successor
of a.)
4.126 In the sense in which we speak of formal properties we can now speak also of formal concepts.
(I introduce this expression in order to make clear the confu- sion of formal concepts with proper concepts which runs through the whole of the old logic.)
That anything falls under a formal concept as an object be- longing to it, cannot be expressed by a proposition. But it shows itself in the sign of this object itself. (The name shows that it signies an object, the numerical sign that it signies a number, etc.)
Formal concepts cannot, like proper concepts, be presented by a function.
For their characteristics, the formal properties, are not ex- pressed by the functions.
The expression of a formal property is a feature of certain symbols.
The sign that signies the characteristics of a formal con- cept is, therefore, a characteristic feature of all symbols, whose meanings fall under the concept.
The expression of the formal concept is therefore a proposi- tional variable in which only this characteristic feature is con- stant.
4.127 The propositional variable signies the formal concept, and its values signify the objects which fall under this concept.
4.1271 Every variable is the sign of a formal concept.
For every variable presents a constant form, which all its values possess, and which can be conceived as a formal property of these values.
47
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
4.1272 So the variable name x is the proper sign of the pseudo-concept
object.
Wherever the word object (thing, entity, etc.) is rightly used, it is expressed in logical symbolism by the variable name.
For example in the proposition there are two objects which . . . , by (∃x,y) . . . .
Wherever it is used otherwise, i.e. as a proper concept word, there arise senseless pseudo-propositions.
So one cannot, e.g. say There are objects as one says There are books. Nor There are 100 objects or There are ℵ0 ob-
jects. And it is senseless to speak of the number of all objects.
The same holds of the words Complex, Fact, Function, Number, etc.
They all signify formal concepts and are presented in logical symbolism by variables, not by functions or classes (as Frege and Russell thought).
Expressions like 1 is a number, there is only one number nought, and all like them are senseless.
(It is as senseless to say, there is only one 1 as it would be to say: 2 + 2 is at 3 o'clock equal to 4.)
4.12721 The formal concept is already given with an object, which falls under it. One cannot, therefore, introduce both, the objects which fall under a formal concept and the formal concept it- self, as primitive ideas. One cannot, therefore, e.g. introduce (as Russell does) the concept of function and also special func- tions as primitive ideas; or the concept of number and denite numbers.
4.1273 If we want to express in logical symbolism the general propo- sition b is a successor of a we need for this an expression for the general term of the formal series: aRb, (∃x) : aRx.xRb,
(∃x,y) : aRx.xRy.yRb, . . . The general term of a formal series can only be expressed by a variable, for the concept symbolized by term of this formal series is a formal concept. (This Frege and Russell overlooked; the way in which they express general propositions like the above is, therefore, false; it contains a vi- cious circle.)
We can determine the general term of the formal series by
48
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
giving its rst term and the general form of the operation, which generates the following term out of the preceding proposition.
4.1274 The question about the existence of a formal concept is senseless. For no proposition can answer such a question.
(For example, one cannot ask: Are there unanalysable sub- ject-predicate propositions?)
4.128 The logical forms are anumerical.
Therefore there are in logic no pre-eminent numbers, and therefore there is no philosophical monism or dualism, etc.
4.2 The sense of a proposition is its agreement and disagreement with the possibilities of the existence and non-existence of the atomic facts.
4.21 The simplest proposition, the elementary proposition, asserts the existence of an atomic fact.
4.211 It is a sign of an elementary proposition, that no elementary proposition can contradict it.
4.22 The elementary proposition consists of names. It is a connexion, a concatenation, of names.
4.221 It is obvious that in the analysis of propositions we must come to elementary propositions, which consist of names in immediate combination.
The question arises here, how the propositional connexion comes to be.
4.2211 Even if the world is innitely complex, so that every fact consists of an innite number of atomic facts and every atomic fact is composed of an innite number of objects, even then there must be objects and atomic facts.
4.23 The name occurs in the proposition only in the context of the elementary proposition.
4.24 The names are the simple symbols, I indicate them by single letters (x, y, z).
The elementary proposition I write as function of the names, in the form fx, ϕ(x,y), etc.
Or I indicate it by the letters p, q, r.
49
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
4.241 If I use two signs with one and the same meaning, I express this by putting between them the sign =.
a = b means then, that the sign a is replaceable by the
sign b.
(If I introduce by an equation a new sign b, by determining that it shall replace a previously known sign a, I write the
equationdenition(like Russell) in the form a= bDef.. A
denition is a symbolic rule.)
4.242 Expressions of the form a = b are therefore only expedients in presentation: They assert nothing about the meaning of the signs a and b.
4.243 Can we understand two names without knowing whether they signify the same thing or two dierent things? Can we under- stand a proposition in which two names occur, without knowing if they mean the same or dierent things?
If I know the meaning of an English and a synonymous Ger- man word, it is impossible for me not to know that they are synonymous, it is impossible for me not to be able to translate them into one another.
Expressions like a = a, or expressions deduced from these are neither elementary propositions nor otherwise signicant signs. (This will be shown later.)
4.25 If the elementary proposition is true, the atomic fact exists; if it is false the atomic fact does not exist.
4.26 The specication of all true elementary propositions describes the world completely. The world is completely described by the specication of all elementary propositions plus the specication, which of them are true and which false.
4.27 With regard to the existence of n atomic facts there are Kn =
n
ν=0
n
ν possibilities.
It is possible for all combinations of atomic facts to exist, and the others not to exist.
4.28 To these combinations correspond the same number of possibili- ties of the truthand falsehoodof nelementary propositions.
4.3 The truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions mean the
50

possibilities of the existence and non-existence of the atomic facts.
4.31 The truth-possibilities can be presented by schemata of the fol- lowing kind (T means true, F false. The rows of T's and F's under the row of the elementary propositions mean their truth-possibilities in an easily intelligible symbolism).

4.4 A proposition is the expression of agreement and disagreement with the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions.
4.41 The truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions are the conditions of the truth and falsehood of the propositions.
4.411 It seems probable even at rst sight that the introduction of the elementary propositions is fundamental for the comprehension of the other kinds of propositions. Indeed the comprehension of the general propositions depends palpably on that of the elementary
propositions.
4.42 With regard to the agreement and disagreement of a proposition with the truth-possibilities of n elementary propositions there
are
Kn
κ=0
Kn
κ
= Ln possibilities.
4.43 Agreement with the truth-possibilities can be expressed by co- ordinating with them in the schema the mark T (true).
Absence of this mark means disagreement.
4.431 The expression of the agreement and disagreement with the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions expresses the truth-conditions of the proposition.
51
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
The proposition is the expression of its truth-conditions.
(Frege has therefore quite rightly put them at the beginning, as explaining the signs of his logical symbolism. Only Frege's explanation of the truth-concept is false: if the true and the false were real objects and the arguments in ∼p, etc., then
the sense of ∼p would by no means be determined by Frege's
determination.)
4.44 The sign which arises from the co-ordination of that mark T with the truth-possibilities is a propositional sign.
4.441 It is clear that to the complex of the signs F and T no object (or complex of objects) corresponds; any more than to horizontal and vertical lines or to brackets. There are no logical objects.
Something analogous holds of course for all signs, which ex- press the same as the schemata of T and F.
4.442 Thus e.g. p q
T T T
F T T
T F
F F T
is a propositional sign.
(Frege's assertion sign ⊢ is logically altogether meaningless; in Frege (and Russell) it only shows that these authors hold as true the propositions marked in this way.
⊢ belongs therefore to the propositions no more than does the number of the proposition. A proposition cannot possibly assert of itself that it is true.)
If the sequence of the truth-possibilities in the schema is once for all determined by a rule of combination, then the last column is by itself an expression of the truth-conditions. If we write this column as a row the propositional sign becomes: (TTT)(p, q),
or more plainly: (TTFT)(p, q).
(The number of places in the left-hand bracket is determined by the number of terms in the right-hand bracket.)
4.45 For n elementary propositions there are Ln possible groups of
truth-conditions.
52
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
The groups of truth-conditions which belong to the truth- possibilities of a number of elementary propositions can be or- dered in a series.
4.46 Among the possible groups of truth-conditions there are two extreme cases.
In the one case the proposition is true for all the truth-pos- sibilities of the elementary propositions. We say that the truth- conditions are tautological.
In the second case the proposition is false for all the truth- possibilities. The truth-conditions are self-contradictory.
In the rst case we call the proposition a tautology, in the second case a contradiction.
4.461 The proposition shows what it says, the tautology and the con- tradiction that they say nothing.
The tautology has no truth-conditions, for it is uncondition- ally true; and the contradiction is on no condition true.
Tautology and contradiction are without sense.
(Like the point from which two arrows go out in opposite directions.)
(I know, e.g. nothing about the weather, when I know that it rains or does not rain.)
4.4611 Tautology and contradiction are, however, not senseless; they are part of the symbolism, in the same way that 0 is part of the symbolism of Arithmetic.
4.462 Tautology and contradiction are not pictures of the reality. They present no possible state of aairs. For the one allows every
possible state of aairs, the other none.
In the tautology the conditions of agreement with the world the presenting relationscancel one another, so that it stands in no presenting relation to reality.
4.463 The truth-conditions determine the range, which is left to the facts by the proposition.
(The proposition, the picture, the model, are in a negative sense like a solid body, which restricts the free movement of another: in a positive sense, like the space limited by solid sub- stance, in which a body may be placed.)
53
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
Tautology leaves to reality the whole innite logical space; contradiction lls the whole logical space and leaves no point to reality. Neither of them, therefore, can in any way determine reality.
4.464 The truth of tautology is certain, of propositions possible, of contradiction impossible. (Certain, possible, impossible: here we have an indication of that gradation which we need in the theory of probability.)
4.465 The logical product of a tautology and a proposition says the same as the proposition. Therefore that product is identical with the proposition. For the essence of the symbol cannot be altered without altering its sense.
4.466 To a denite logical combination of signs corresponds a denite logical combination of their meanings; every arbitrary combina-
tion only corresponds to the unconnected signs.
That is, propositions which are true for every state of aairs cannot be combinations of signs at all, for otherwise there could only correspond to them denite combinations of objects.
(And to no logical combination corresponds no combination
of the objects.)
Tautology and contradiction are the limiting cases of the combinations of symbols, namely their dissolution.
4.4661 Of course the signs are also combined with one another in the tautology and contradiction, i.e. they stand in relations to one another, but these relations are meaningless, unessential to the
symbol.
4.5 Now it appears to be possible to give the most general form of proposition; i.e. to give a description of the propositions of some one sign language, so that every possible sense can be expressed by a symbol, which falls under the description, and so that every symbol which falls under the description can express a sense, if the meanings of the names are chosen accordingly.
It is clear that in the description of the most general form of proposition only what is essential to it may be described otherwise it would not be the most general form.
That there is a general form is proved by the fact that there
54
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
cannot be a proposition whose form could not have been foreseen (i.e. constructed). The general form of proposition is: Such and such is the case.
4.51 Suppose all elementary propositions were given me: then we can simply ask: what propositions I can build out of them. And these are all propositions and so are they limited.
4.52 The propositions are everything which follows from the totality of all elementary propositions (of course also from the fact that it is the totality of them all ). (So, in some sense, one could
say, that all propositions are generalizations of the elementary propositions.)
4.53 The general propositional form is a variable.
5 Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.
(An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)
5.01 The elementary propositions are the truth-arguments of propo- sitions.
5.02 It is natural to confuse the arguments of functions with the indices of names. For I recognize the meaning of the sign con- taining it from the argument just as much as from the index.
In Russell's +c, for example, c is an index which indicates that the whole sign is the addition sign for cardinal numbers. But this way of symbolizing depends on arbitrary agreement, and one could choose a simple sign instead of +c: but in ∼p
p is not an index but an argument; the sense of ∼p cannot
be understood, unless the sense of p has previously been un- derstood. (In the name Julius Cæsar, Julius is an index. The index is always part of a description of the object to whose name we attach it, e.g. The Cæsar of the Julian gens.)
The confusion of argument and index is, if I am not mistaken, at the root of Frege's theory of the meaning of propositions and functions. For Frege the propositions of logic were names and their arguments the indices of these names.
5.1 The truth-functions can be ordered in series.
That is the foundation of the theory of probability.
55
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
5.101 The truth-functions of every number of elementary propositions can be written in a schema of the following kind:
(TTTT)(p, q) Tautology (if p then p, and if q then q) [p ⊃p . q ⊃q]
(FTTT)(p, q) in words: Not both p and q. [∼(p . q)]
(TFTT)(p, q) If q then p. [q ⊃p]
(TTFT)(p, q) If p then q. [p ⊃q]
(TTTF)(p, q) p or q. [p ∨q]
(FFTT)(p, q) Not q. [∼q]
(FTFT)(p, q) Not p. [∼p]
(FTTF)(p, q) p or q, but not both. [p .∼q : ∨: q .∼p]
(TFFT)(p, q) If p, then q; and if q, then p. [p ≡q]
(TFTF)(p, q) p
(TTFF)(p, q) q
(FFFT)(p, q) Neither p nor q. [∼p .∼q or p |q]
(FFTF)(p, q) p and not q. [p .∼q]
(FTFF)(p, q) q and not p. [q .∼p]
(TFFF)(p, q) p and q. [p . q]
(FFFF)(p, q) Contradiction (p and not p; and q and not q.) [p .∼p . q .∼q]
Those truth-possibilities of its truth-arguments, which verify the proposition, I shall call its truth-grounds.
5.11 If the truth-grounds which are common to a number of proposi- tions are all also truth-grounds of some one proposition, we say that the truth of this proposition follows from the truth of those propositions.
5.12 In particular the truth of a proposition p follows from that of a
proposition q, if all the truth-grounds of the second are truth- grounds of the rst.
5.121 The truth-grounds of q are contained in those of p; p follows
from q.
5.122 If p follows from q, the sense of p is contained in that of q.
5.123 If a god creates a world in which certain propositions are true, he creates thereby also a world in which all propositions consequent on them are true. And similarly he could not create a world in which the proposition p is true without creating all its objects.
5.124 A proposition asserts every proposition which follows from it.
5.1241 p.q is one of the propositions which assert p and at the same
time one of the propositions which assert q.
56
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
Two propositions are opposed to one another if there is no signicant proposition which asserts them both.
Every proposition which contradicts another, denies it.
5.13 That the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of other propositions, we perceive from the structure of the propositions.
5.131 If the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of others, this expresses itself in relations in which the forms of these prop- ositions stand to one another, and we do not need to put them in these relations rst by connecting them with one another in a proposition; for these relations are internal, and exist as soon as, and by the very fact that, the propositions exist.
5.1311 When we conclude from p∨q and ∼pto q the relation between
the forms of the propositions p∨q and ∼p is here concealed by the method of symbolizing. But if we write, e.g. instead of
p∨q p|q.|.p|q and instead of ∼p p|p (p|q = neither
p nor q), then the inner connexion becomes obvious.
(The fact that we can infer fafrom (x) .fxshows that gen-
erality is present also in the symbol (x) .fx.
5.132 If p follows from q, I can conclude from q to p; infer p from q.
The method of inference is to be understood from the two propositions alone.
Only they themselves can justify the inference.
Laws of inference, whichas in Frege and Russellare to justify the conclusions, are senseless and would be superuous.
5.133 All inference takes place a priori.
5.134 From an elementary proposition no other can be inferred.
5.135 In no way can an inference be made from the existence of one state of aairs to the existence of another entirely dierent from it.
5.136 There is no causal nexus which justies such an inference.
5.1361 The events of the future cannot be inferred from those of the
present.
Superstition is the belief in the causal nexus.
5.1362 The freedom of the will consists in the fact that future actions
57
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
cannot be known now. We could only know them if causality were an inner necessity, like that of logical deduction.The connexion of knowledge and what is known is that of logical necessity.
(A knows that pis the case is senseless if pis a tautology.)
5.1363 If from the fact that a proposition is obvious to us it does not
follow that it is true, then obviousness is no justication for our belief in its truth.
5.14 If a proposition follows from another, then the latter says more than the former, the former less than the latter.
5.141 If pfollows from q and q from pthen they are one and the same
proposition.
5.142 A tautology follows from all propositions: it says nothing.
5.143 Contradiction is something shared by propositions, which no
proposition has in common with another. Tautology is that which is shared by all propositions, which have nothing in com- mon with one another.
Contradiction vanishes so to speak outside, tautology inside all propositions.
Contradiction is the external limit of the propositions, tau- tology their substanceless centre.
5.15 If Tr is the number of the truth-grounds of the proposition r,
Trs the number of those truth-grounds of the proposition s
which are at the same time truth-grounds of r, then we call
the ratio Trs : Tr the measure of the probability which the prop-
osition r gives to the proposition s.
5.151 Suppose in a schema like that above in No. 5.101 Tr is the num-
ber of the T 's in the proposition r, Trs the number of those
T 's in the proposition s, which stand in the same columns as
T 's of the proposition r; then the proposition r gives to the
proposition s the probability Trs : Tr.
5.1511 There is no special object peculiar to probability propositions.
5.152 Propositions which have no truth-arguments in common with one another we call independent.
58
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
Independent propositions (e.g. any two elementary proposi- tions) give to one another the probability 1
2 .
If pfollows from q, the proposition q gives to the proposition
p the probability 1. The certainty of logical conclusion is a limiting case of probability.
(Application to tautology and contradiction.)
5.153 A proposition is in itself neither probable nor improbable. An event occurs or does not occur, there is no middle course.
5.154 In an urn there are equal numbers of white and black balls (and no others). I draw one ball after another and put them back in the urn. Then I can determine by the experiment that the num- bers of the black and white balls which are drawn approximate as the drawing continues.
So this is not a mathematical fact.
If then, I say, It is equally probable that I should draw a white and a black ball, this means, All the circumstances known to me (including the natural laws hypothetically assumed) give to the occurrence of the one event no more probability than to the occurrence of the other. That is they giveas can easily be understood from the above explanationsto each the probabil- ity 1

What I can verify by the experiment is that the occurrence of the two events is independent of the circumstances with which I have no closer acquaintance.
5.155 The unit of the probability proposition is: The circumstances with which I am not further acquaintedgive to the occurrence of a denite event such and such a degree of probability.
5.156 Probability is a generalization.
It involves a general description of a propositional form. Only in default of certainty do we need probability.
If we are not completely acquainted with a fact, but know
something about its form.
(A proposition can, indeed, be an incomplete picture of a certain state of aairs, but it is always a complete picture.)
The probability proposition is, as it were, an extract from other propositions.

TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
5.2 The structures of propositions stand to one another in internal relations.
5.21 We can bring out these internal relations in our manner of ex- pression, by presenting a proposition as the result of an opera- tion which produces it from other propositions (the bases of the operation).
5.22 The operation is the expression of a relation between the struc- tures of its result and its bases.
5.23 The operation is that which must happen to a proposition in order to make another out of it.
5.231 And that will naturally depend on their formal properties, on the internal similarity of their forms.
5.232 The internal relation which orders a series is equivalent to the operation by which one term arises from another.
5.233 The rst place in which an operation can occur is where a prop- osition arises from another in a logically signicant way; i.e.
where the logical construction of the proposition begins.
5.234 The truth-functions of elementary propositions, are results of operations which have the elementary propositions as bases. (I call these operations, truth-operations.)
5.2341 The sense of a truth-function of pis a function of the sense of p.
Denial, logical addition, logical multiplication, etc. etc., are operations.
(Denial reverses the sense of a proposition.)
5.24 An operation shows itself in a variable; it shows how we can proceed from one form of proposition to another.
It gives expression to the dierence between the forms.
(And that which is common to the bases, and the result of an operation, is the bases themselves.)
5.241 The operation does not characterize a form but only the dier- ence between forms.
5.242 The same operation which makes q from p, makes r from
q, and so on. This can only be expressed by the fact that
p, q, r, etc., are variables which give general expression to certain formal relations.
60
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
5.25 The occurrence of an operation does not characterize the sense of a proposition.
For an operation does not assert anything; only its result does, and this depends on the bases of the operation.
(Operation and function must not be confused with one an- other.)
5.251 A function cannot be its own argument, but the result of an operation can be its own basis.
5.252 Only in this way is the progress from term to term in a formal series possible (from type to type in the hierarchy of Russell and Whitehead). (Russell and Whitehead have not admitted the possibility of this progress but have made use of it all the same.)
5.2521 The repeated application of an operation to its own result I call its successive application (O′O′O′a is the result of the threefold
successive application of O′ξ to a).
In a similar sense I speak of the successive application of
several operations to a number of propositions.
5.2522 The general term of the formal series a,O′a,O′O′a, .... I write
thus: [a, x, O′x]. This expression in brackets is a variable. The rst term of the expression is the beginning of the formal series, the second the form of an arbitrary term x of the series, and the third the form of that term of the series which immediately follows x.
5.2523 The concept of the successive application of an operation is equivalent to the concept and so on.
5.253 One operation can reverse the eect of another. Operations can cancel one another.
5.254 Operations can vanish (e.g. denial in ∼∼p, ∼∼p= p).
5.3 All propositions are results of truth-operations on the elemen- tary propositions.
The truth-operation is the way in which a truth-function arises from elementary propositions.
According to the nature of truth-operations, in the same way as out of elementary propositions arise their truth-functions,
61
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
from truth-functions arises a new one. Every truth-operation creates from truth-functions of elementary propositions another truth-function of elementary propositions, i.e. a proposition. The result of every truth-operation on the results of truth-oper- ations on elementary propositions is also the result of one truth-
operation on elementary propositions.
Every proposition is the result of truth-operations on ele- mentary propositions.
5.31 The Schemata No. 4.31 are also signicant, if p, q, r, etc.
are not elementary propositions.
And it is easy to see that the propositional sign in No. 4.442 expresses one truth-function of elementary propositions even when p and q are truth-functions of elementary propositions.
5.32 All truth-functions are results of the successive application of a nite number of truth-operations to elementary propositions.
5.4 Here it becomes clear that there are no such things as logical objects or logical constants (in the sense of Frege and Russell).
5.41 For all those results of truth-operations on truth-functions are identical, which are one and the same truth-function of elemen- tary propositions.
5.42 That ∨, ⊃, etc., are not relations in the sense of right and left, etc., is obvious.
The possibility of crosswise denition of the logical primitive signs of Frege and Russell shows by itself that these are not primitive signs and that they signify no relations.
And it is obvious that the ⊃ which we dene by means of
∼ and ∨ is identical with that by which we dene ∨ with
the help of ∼, and that this ∨ is the same as the rst, and
so on.
5.43 That from a fact p an innite number of others should follow,
namely ∼∼p, ∼∼∼∼p, etc., is indeed hardly to be believed, and it is no less wonderful that the innite number of propositions of logic (of mathematics) should follow from half a dozen primitive propositions.
But all propositions of logic say the same thing. That is, nothing.
62
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
5.44 Truth-functions are not material functions.
If e.g. an armation can be produced by repeated denial, is the denialin any sensecontained in the armation?
Does ∼∼p deny ∼p, or does it arm p; or both?
The proposition ∼∼p does not treat of denial as an object, but the possibility of denial is already prejudged in armation.
And if there was an object called ∼, then ∼∼p would
have to say something other than p. For the one proposition
would then treat of ∼, the other would not.
5.441 This disappearance of the apparent logical constants also occurs if ∼(∃x).
∼fx says the same as (x) .fx, or (∃x) .fx.x= a
the same as fa.
5.442 If a proposition is given to us then the results of all truth- operations which have it as their basis are given with it.
5.45 If there are logical primitive signs a correct logic must make clear their position relative to one another and justify their existence. The construction of logic out of its primitive signs must become
clear.
5.451 If logic has primitive ideas these must be independent of one an- other. If a primitive idea is introduced it must be introduced in all contexts in which it occurs at all. One cannot therefore intro- duce it for one context and then again for another. For example, if denial is introduced, we must understand it in propositions of the form ∼p, just as in propositions like ∼(p∨q), (∃x).
∼fx
and others. We may not rst introduce it for one class of cases and then for another, for it would then remain doubtful whether its meaning in the two cases was the same, and there would be no reason to use the same way of symbolizing in the two cases.
(In short, what Frege (Grundgesetze der Arithmetik) has said about the introduction of signs by denitions holds, mutatis mutandis, for the introduction of primitive signs also.)
5.452 The introduction of a new expedient in the symbolism of logic must always be an event full of consequences. No new symbol may be introduced in logic in brackets or in the marginwith, so to speak, an entirely innocent face.
(Thus in the Principia Mathematica of Russell and White-
63
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
head there occur denitions and primitive propositions in words. Why suddenly words here? This would need a justication. There was none, and can be none for the process is actually not allowed.)
But if the introduction of a new expedient has proved nec- essary in one place, we must immediately ask: Where is this expedient always to be used? Its position in logic must be made
clear.
5.453 All numbers in logic must be capable of justication.
Or rather it must become plain that there are no numbers in logic.
There are no pre-eminent numbers.
5.454 In logic there is no side by side, there can be no classication.
In logic there cannot be a more general and a more special.
5.4541 The solution of logical problems must be simple for they set the standard of simplicity.
Men have always thought that there must be a sphere of questions whose answersa prioriare symmetrical and united into a closed regular structure.
A sphere in which the proposition, simplex sigillum veri, is valid.
5.46 When we have rightly introduced the logical signs, the sense of all their combinations has been already introduced with them: therefore not only p∨q but also ∼(p∨∼q), etc. etc. We should then already have introduced the eect of all possible combinations of brackets; and it would then have become clear that the proper general primitive signs are not p∨q, (∃x).fx,
etc., but the most general form of their combinations.
5.461 The apparently unimportant fact that the apparent relations like ∨and ⊃need bracketsunlike real relations is of great
importance.
The use of brackets with these apparent primitive signs shows that these are not the real primitive signs; and nobody of course would believe that the brackets have meaning by themselves.
5.4611 Logical operation signs are punctuations.
64
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
5.47 It is clear that everything which can be said beforehand about
the form of all propositions at all can be said on one occasion.
For all logical operations are already contained in the elemen- tary proposition. For fa says the same as (∃x) .fx.x= a.
Where there is composition, there is argument and function, and where these are, all logical constants already are.
One could say: the one logical constant is that which all
propositions, according to their nature, have in common with one another.
That however is the general form of proposition.
5.471 The general form of proposition is the essence of proposition.
5.4711 To give the essence of proposition means to give the essence of all description, therefore the essence of the world.
5.472 The description of the most general propositional form is the description of the one and only general primitive sign in logic.
5.473 Logic must take care of itself.
A possible sign must also be able to signify. Everything which is possible in logic is also permitted. (Socrates is identi- cal means nothing because there is no property which is called identical. The proposition is senseless because we have not made some arbitrary determination, not because the symbol is in itself unpermissible.)
In a certain sense we cannot make mistakes in logic.
5.4731 Self-evidence, of which Russell has said so much, can only be discarded in logic by language itself preventing every logical mis- take. That logic is a priori consists in the fact that we cannot
think illogically.
5.4732 We cannot give a sign the wrong sense.
5.47321 Occam's razor is, of course, not an arbitrary rule nor one justied by its practical success. It simply says that unnecessary elements
in a symbolism mean nothing.
Signs which serve one purpose are logically equivalent, signs
which serve no purpose are logically meaningless.
5.4733 Frege says: Every legitimately constructed proposition must have a sense; and I say: Every possible proposition is legit-
65
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
imately constructed, and if it has no sense this can only be because we have given no meaning to some of its constituent
parts.
(Even if we believe that we have done so.)
Thus Socrates is identical says nothing, because we have given no meaning to the word identical as adjective. For when it occurs as the sign of equality it symbolizes in an entirely dif- ferent waythe symbolizing relation is anothertherefore the symbol is in the two cases entirely dierent; the two symbols have the sign in common with one another only by accident.
5.474 The number of necessary fundamental operations depends only
on our notation.
5.475 It is only a question of constructing a system of signs of a denite number of dimensionsof a denite mathematical multiplicity.
5.476 It is clear that we are not concerned here with a number of
primitive ideas which must be signied but with the expression
of a rule.
5.5 Every truth-function is a result of the successive application of the operation ( T)(ξ,....) to elementary propositions.
This operation denies all the propositions in the right-hand bracket and I call it the negation of these propositions.
5.501 An expression in brackets whose terms are propositions I indi- cateif the order of the terms in the bracket is indierentby a sign of the form (ξ). ξ is a variable whose values are the terms of the expression in brackets, and the line over the variable indicates that it stands for all its values in the bracket.
(Thus if ξ has the 3 values P, Q, R, then (ξ) = (P, Q, R).)
The values of the variables must be determined.
The determination is the description of the propositions which the variable stands for.
How the description of the terms of the expression in brackets takes place is unessential.
We may distinguish 3 kinds of description: 1. Direct enu- meration. In this case we can place simply its constant values instead of the variable. 2. Giving a function fx, whose values for
all values of x are the propositions to be described. 3. Giving
66
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
a formal law, according to which those propositions are con- structed. In this case the terms of the expression in brackets are all the terms of a formal series.
5.502 Therefore I write instead of ( T)(ξ,....), N(ξ).
N(ξ) is the negation of all the values of the propositional
variable ξ.
5.503 As it is obviously easy to express how propositions can be con- structed by means of this operation and how propositions are not to be constructed by means of it, this must be capable of exact expression.
5.51 If ξ has only one value, then N(ξ) =∼p (not p), if it has two
values then N(ξ) =∼p.∼q (neither p nor q).
5.511 How can the all-embracing logic which mirrors the world use such special catches and manipulations? Only because all these are connected into an innitely ne network, to the great mirror.
5.512 ∼p is true if p is false. Therefore in the true proposition
∼p p is a false proposition. How then can the stroke ∼
bring it into agreement with reality?
That which denies in ∼p is however not ∼, but that which
all signs of this notation, which deny p, have in common.
Hence the common rule according to which ∼p, ∼∼∼p,
∼p∨∼p, ∼p.∼p, etc. etc. (to innity) are constructed. And this which is common to them all mirrors denial.
5.513 We could say: What is common to all symbols, which assert both p and q, is the proposition p.q. What is common to all
symbols, which assert either p or q, is the proposition p∨q.
And similarly we can say: Two propositions are opposed to one another when they have nothing in common with one another; and every proposition has only one negative, because there is only one proposition which lies altogether outside it.
Thus even in Russell's notation it is evident that q: p∨∼p
says the same as q; that p∨∼p says nothing.
5.514 If a notation is xed, there is in it a rule according to which all the propositions denying p are constructed, a rule according to which all the propositions asserting p are constructed, a rule
67
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
according to which all the propositions asserting por q are con- structed, and so on. These rules are equivalent to the symbols and in them their sense is mirrored.
5.515 It must be recognized in our symbols that what is connected by
∨, ., etc., must be propositions.
And this is the case, for the symbols p and q presuppose
∨, ∼, etc. If the sign p in p∨q does not stand for a complex sign, then by itself it cannot have sense; but then also the signs p∨p, p.p, etc. which have the same sense as p
have no sense. If, however, p∨p has no sense, then also p∨q
can have no sense.
5.5151 Must the sign of the negative proposition be constructed by means of the sign of the positive? Why should one not be able to express the negative proposition by means of a negative fact? (Like: if a does not stand in a certain relation to b, it could
express that aRb is not the case.)
But here also the negative proposition is indirectly con- structed with the positive.
The positive proposition must presuppose the existence of
the negative proposition and conversely.
5.52 If the values of ξ are the total values of a function fx for all
values of x, then N(ξ) =∼(∃x) .fx.
5.521 I separate the concept all from the truth-function.
Frege and Russell have introduced generality in connexion with the logical product or the logical sum. Then it would be dicult to understand the propositions (∃x).fx and (x).fx
in which both ideas lie concealed.
5.522 That which is peculiar to the symbolism of generality is rstly, that it refers to a logical prototype, and secondly, that it makes constants prominent.
5.523 The generality symbol occurs as an argument.
5.524 If the objects are given, therewith are all objects also given.
If the elementary propositions are given, then therewith all
elementary propositions are also given.
5.525 It is not correct to render the proposition (∃x).fxas Russell
doesin words fx is possible.
68
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
Certainty, possibility or impossibility of a state of aairs are not expressed by a proposition but by the fact that an expression is a tautology, a signicant proposition or a contradiction.
That precedent to which one would always appeal, must be present in the symbol itself.
5.526 One can describe the world completely by completely general- ized propositions, i.e. without from the outset co-ordinating any name with a denite object.
In order then to arrive at the customary way of expression we need simply say after an expression there is one and only one x, which ....: and this x is a.
5.5261 A completely generalized proposition is like every other proposi- tion composite. (This is shown by the fact that in (∃x,ϕ) .ϕx
we must mention ϕ and x separately. Both stand indepen- dently in signifying relations to the world as in the ungeneralized proposition.)
A characteristic of a composite symbol: it has something in common with other symbols.
5.5262 The truth or falsehood of every proposition alters something in the general structure of the world. And the range which is allowed to its structure by the totality of elementary proposi- tions is exactly that which the completely general propositions delimit.
(If an elementary proposition is true, then, at any rate, there is one more elementary proposition true.)
5.53 Identity of the object I express by identity of the sign and not by means of a sign of identity. Dierence of the objects by dierence of the signs.
5.5301 That identity is not a relation between objects is obvious. This becomes very clear if, for example, one considers the proposition
(x) : fx.⊃.x= a. What this proposition says is simply that
only a satises the function f, and not that only such things
satisfy the function f which have a certain relation to a.
One could of course say that in fact only a has this relation
to a, but in order to express this we should need the sign of identity itself.
69
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
5.5302 Russell's denition of = won't do; because according to it one cannot say that two objects have all their properties in com- mon. (Even if this proposition is never true, it is nevertheless
signicant.)
5.5303 Roughly speaking: to say of two things that they are identical is
nonsense, and to say of one thing that it is identical with itself
is to say nothing.
5.531 I write therefore not f(a,b) .a= b, but f(a,a) (or f(b,b)).
And not f(a,b).
∼a= b, but f(a,b).
5.532 And analogously: not (∃x,y).f(x,y).x= y, but (∃x).f(x,x);
and not (∃x,y) .f(x,y).
∼x= y, but (∃x,y) .f(x,y).
(Therefore instead of Russell's (∃x,y) .f(x,y): (∃x,y).
f(x,y).∨.(∃x) .f(x,x).)
5.5321 Instead of (x) : fx⊃x= a we therefore write e.g. (∃x).fx.⊃
.fa: ∼(∃x,y) .fx.fy.
And the proposition only one x satises f() reads: (∃x).
fx: ∼(∃x,y) .fx.fy.
5.533 The identity sign is therefore not an essential constituent of log- ical notation.
5.534 And we see that apparent propositions like: a= a, a= b.b=
c.⊃a= c, (x) .x= x, (∃x) .x= a, etc. cannot be written
in a correct logical notation at all.
5.535 So all problems disappear which are connected with such pseu- do-propositions.
This is the place to solve all the problems which arise through Russell's Axiom of Innity.
What the axiom of innity is meant to say would be ex- pressed in language by the fact that there is an innite number of names with dierent meanings.
5.5351 There are certain cases in which one is tempted to use expres- sions of the form a = a or p ⊃p and of that kind. And indeed this takes place when one would like to speak of the archetype Proposition, Thing, etc. So Russell in the Principles
of Mathematics has rendered the nonsense pis a proposition in
symbols by p⊃p and has put it as hypothesis before certain
70
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
propositions to show that their places for arguments could only be occupied by propositions.
(It is nonsense to place the hypothesis p⊃pbefore a propo- sition in order to ensure that its arguments have the right form, because the hypothesis for a non-proposition as argument be- comes not false but meaningless, and because the proposition itself becomes senseless for arguments of the wrong kind, and therefore it survives the wrong arguments no better and no worse than the senseless hypothesis attached for this purpose.)
5.5352 Similarly it was proposed to express There are no things by
∼(∃x) .x = x. But even if this were a propositionwould it not be true if indeed There were things, but these were not identical with themselves?
5.54 In the general propositional form, propositions occur in a prop- osition only as bases of the truth-operations.
5.541 At rst sight it appears as if there were also a dierent way in which one proposition could occur in another.
Especially in certain propositional forms of psychology, like A thinks, that p is the case, or A thinks p, etc.
Here it appears supercially as if the proposition p stood to
the object A in a kind of relation.
(And in modern epistemology (Russell, Moore, etc.) those propositions have been conceived in this way.)
5.542 But it is clear that A believes that p, A thinks p, A says p,
are of the form `p' says p: and here we have no co-ordination of a fact and an object, but a co-ordination of facts by means of a co-ordination of their objects.
5.5421 This shows that there is no such thing as the soulthe subject, etc.as it is conceived in contemporary supercial psychology.
A composite soul would not be a soul any longer.
5.5422 The correct explanation of the form of the proposition A judges
p must show that it is impossible to judge a nonsense. (Russell's theory does not satisfy this condition.)
5.5423 To perceive a complex means to perceive that its constituents are combined in such and such a way.
71
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
This perhaps explains that the gure
can be seen in two ways as a cube; and all similar phenomena. For we really see two dierent facts.
(If I x my eyes rst on the corners a and only glance at b,
a appears in front and b behind, and vice versa.)
5.55 We must now answer a priori the question as to all possible forms of the elementary propositions.
The elementary proposition consists of names. Since we can- not give the number of names with dierent meanings, we cannot give the composition of the elementary proposition.
5.551 Our fundamental principle is that every question which can be decided at all by logic can be decided without further trouble.
(And if we get into a situation where we need to answer such a problem by looking at the world, this shows that we are on a fundamentally wrong track.)
5.552 The experience which we need to understand logic is not that such and such is the case, but that something is; but that is no
experience.
Logic precedes every experiencethat something is so.
It is before the How, not before the What.
5.5521 And if this were not the case, how could we apply logic? We could say: if there were a logic, even if there were no world, how then could there be a logic, since there is a world?
5.553 Russell said that there were simple relations between dierent numbers of things (individuals). But between what numbers? And how should this be decidedby experience?
(There is no pre-eminent number.)
72
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
5.554 5.5541 5.5542 The enumeration of any special forms would be entirely arbi- trary.
It should be possible to decide a priori whether, for example, I can get into a situation in which I need to symbolize with a sign of a 27-termed relation.
May we then ask this at all? Can we set out a sign form and not know whether anything can correspond to it?
Has the question sense: what must be in order that some-
thing can be the case?
5.555 It is clear that we have a concept of the elementary proposition apart from its special logical form.
Where, however, we can build symbols according to a system, there this system is the logically important thing and not the single symbols.
And how would it be possible that I should have to deal with forms in logic which I can invent: but I must have to deal with that which makes it possible for me to invent them.
5.556 There cannot be a hierarchy of the forms of the elementary prop- ositions. Only that which we ourselves construct can we foresee.
5.5561 Empirical reality is limited by the totality of objects. The boundary appears again in the totality of elementary propo- sitions.
The hierarchies are and must be independent of reality.
5.5562 If we know on purely logical grounds, that there must be ele- mentary propositions, then this must be known by everyone who understands the propositions in their unanalysed form.
5.5563 All propositions of our colloquial language are actually, just as they are, logically completely in order. That most simple thing which we ought to give here is not a simile of truth but the complete truth itself.
(Our problems are not abstract but perhaps the most con- crete that there are.)
5.557 The application of logic decides what elementary propositions
there are.
What lies in the application logic cannot anticipate.
73
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
It is clear that logic may not collide with its application.
But logic must have contact with its application.
Therefore logic and its application may not overlap one an- other.
5.5571 If I cannot give elementary propositions a priori then it must lead to obvious nonsense to try to give them.
5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
5.61 Logic lls the world: the limits of the world are also its limits.
We cannot therefore say in logic: This and this there is in the world, that there is not.
For that would apparently presuppose that we exclude cer- tain possibilities, and this cannot be the case since otherwise logic must get outside the limits of the world: that is, if it could consider these limits from the other side also.
What we cannot think, that we cannot think: we cannot therefore say what we cannot think.
5.62 This remark provides a key to the question, to what extent solip- sism is a truth.
In fact what solipsism means, is quite correct, only it cannot
be said, but it shows itself.
That the world is my world, shows itself in the fact that the limits of the language (the language which only I understand) mean the limits of my world.
5.621 The world and life are one.
5.63 I am my world. (The microcosm.)
5.631 The thinking, presenting subject; there is no such thing.
If I wrote a book The world as I found it, I should also have therein to report on my body and say which members obey my will and which do not, etc. This then would be a method of isolating the subject or rather of showing that in an important sense there is no subject: that is to say, of it alone in this book mention could not be made.
5.632 The subject does not belong to the world but it is a limit of the world.
74
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
5.633 Where in the world is a metaphysical subject to be noted?
You say that this case is altogether like that of the eye and the eld of sight. But you do not really see the eye.
And from nothing in the eld of sight can it be concluded
that it is seen from an eye.
5.6331 For the eld of sight has not a form like this:
5.634 This is connected with the fact that no part of our experience is also a priori.
Everything we see could also be otherwise.
Everything we can describe at all could also be otherwise.
There is no order of things a priori.
5.64 Here we see that solipsism strictly carried out coincides with pure realism. The I in solipsism shrinks to an extensionless point and there remains the reality co-ordinated with it.
5.641 There is therefore really a sense in which in philosophy we can talk of a non-psychological I.
The I occurs in philosophy through the fact that the world is my world.
The philosophical I is not the man, not the human body or the human soul of which psychology treats, but the metaphysical subject, the limitnot a part of the world.
6 The general form of truth-function is: [p,ξ,N(ξ)].
This is the general form of proposition.
6.001 6.002 This says nothing else than that every proposition is the result of successive applications of the operation N′(ξ) to the elementary
propositions.
If we are given the general form of the way in which a proposition is constructed, then thereby we are also given the general form of the way in which by an operation out of one proposition another can be created.
75
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
6.01 The general form of the operation Ω′(η) is therefore: [ξ,N(ξ)]′(η)
(= [η, ξ, N(ξ)]).
This is the most general form of transition from one propo- sition to another.
6.02 And thus we come to numbers: I dene
x= Ω0′x Def. and
Ω′Ων′x= Ων+1′x Def.
According, then, to these symbolic rules we write the series
x, Ω′x, Ω′Ω′x, Ω′Ω′Ω′x.....
as: Ω0′x,Ω0+1′x,Ω0+1+1′x,Ω0+1+1+1′x.....
Therefore I write in place of [x,ξ,Ω′ξ],
“[Ω0′x,Ων′x,Ων+1′x].
And I dene:
0 + 1 = 1 Def.
0 + 1 + 1 = 2 Def.
0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 Def.
and so on.
6.021 A number is the exponent of an operation.
6.022 The concept number is nothing else than that which is common to all numbers, the general form of number.
The concept number is the variable number.
And the concept of equality of numbers is the general form of all special equalities of numbers.
6.03 The general form of the cardinal number is: [0,ξ,ξ+ 1].
6.031 The theory of classes is altogether superuous in mathematics.
This is connected with the fact that the generality which we need in mathematics is not the accidental one.
6.1 The propositions of logic are tautologies.
76
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
6.11 The propositions of logic therefore say nothing. (They are the analytical propositions.)
6.111 Theories which make a proposition of logic appear substantial are always false. One could e.g. believe that the words true and false signify two properties among other properties, and then it would appear as a remarkable fact that every proposi- tion possesses one of these properties. This now by no means appears self-evident, no more so than the proposition All roses are either yellow or red would sound even if it were true. Indeed our proposition now gets quite the character of a proposition of natural science and this is a certain symptom of its being falsely understood.
6.112 The correct explanation of logical propositions must give them a peculiar position among all propositions.
6.113 It is the characteristic mark of logical propositions that one can perceive in the symbol alone that they are true; and this fact contains in itself the whole philosophy of logic. And so also it is one of the most important facts that the truth or falsehood of non-logical propositions can not be recognized from the propo-
sitions alone.
6.12 The fact that the propositions of logic are tautologies shows the
formallogicalproperties of language, of the world.
That its constituent parts connected together in this way
give a tautology characterizes the logic of its constituent parts.
In order that propositions connected together in a denite way may give a tautology they must have denite properties of structure. That they give a tautology when so connected shows therefore that they possess these properties of structure.
6.1201 That e.g. the propositions p and ∼p in the connexion ∼(p.
∼p) give a tautology shows that they contradict one another. That the propositions p ⊃q, p and q connected together
in the form (p⊃q).(p) :⊃: (q) give a tautology shows that q
follows from p and p⊃q. That (x) .fx:⊃: fa is a tautology
shows that fa follows from (x) .fx, etc. etc.
6.1202 It is clear that we could have used for this purpose contradictions instead of tautologies.
77
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
6.1203 In order to recognize a tautology as such, we can, in cases in which no sign of generality occurs in the tautology, make use of the following intuitive method: I write instead of p, q,
r, etc., TpF, TqF, TrF, etc. The truth-combinations I
express by brackets, e.g.:
and the co-ordination of the truth or falsity of the whole prop- osition with the truth-combinations of the truth-arguments by lines in the following way:
This sign, for example, would therefore present the proposi- tion p⊃q. Now I will proceed to inquire whether such a prop-
osition as ∼(p.∼p) (The Law of Contradiction) is a tautology.
The form ∼ξ is written in our notation
the form ξ.η thus:
78
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
Hence the proposition ∼(p.∼q) runs thus:
If here we put p instead of q and examine the combination of the outermost T and F with the innermost, it is seen that the truth of the whole proposition is co-ordinated with all the truth-combinations of its argument, its falsity with none of the truth-combinations.
6.121 The propositions of logic demonstrate the logical properties of propositions, by combining them into propositions which say nothing.
This method could be called a zero-method. In a logical proposition propositions are brought into equilibrium with one another, and the state of equilibrium then shows how these prop- ositions must be logically constructed.
6.122 Whence it follows that we can get on without logical proposi- tions, for we can recognize in an adequate notation the formal properties of the propositions by mere inspection.
6.1221 If for example two propositions p and q give a tautology in
the connexion p⊃q, then it is clear that q follows from p.
E.g. that q follows from p⊃q.p we see from these two propositions themselves, but we can also show it by combining them to p⊃q.p:⊃: q and then showing that this is a tautology.
6.1222 This throws light on the question why logical propositions can no more be empirically established than they can be empirically refuted. Not only must a proposition of logic be incapable of being contradicted by any possible experience, but it must also be incapable of being established by any such.
6.1223 It now becomes clear why we often feel as though logical truths
79
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
must be postulated by us. We can in fact postulate them in so far as we can postulate an adequate notation.
6.1224 It also becomes clear why logic has been called the theory of forms and of inference.
6.123 It is clear that the laws of logic cannot themselves obey further logical laws.
(There is not, as Russell supposed, for every type a special law of contradiction; but one is sucient, since it is not applied to itself.)
6.1231 The mark of logical propositions is not their general validity.
To be general is only to be accidentally valid for all things. An ungeneralized proposition can be tautologous just as well as a generalized one.
6.1232 Logical general validity, we could call essential as opposed to accidental general validity, e.g. of the proposition all men are mortal. Propositions like Russell's axiom of reducibility are not logical propositions, and this explains our feeling that, if true, they can only be true by a happy chance.
6.1233 We can imagine a world in which the axiom of reducibility is not valid. But it is clear that logic has nothing to do with the question whether our world is really of this kind or not.
6.124 The logical propositions describe the scaolding of the world, or rather they present it. They treat of nothing. They pre- suppose that names have meaning, and that elementary propo- sitions have sense. And this is their connexion with the world. It is clear that it must show something about the world that certain combinations of symbolswhich essentially have a def- inite characterare tautologies. Herein lies the decisive point. We said that in the symbols which we use much is arbitrary, much not. In logic only this expresses: but this means that in logic it is not we who express, by means of signs, what we want, but in logic the nature of the essentially necessary signs itself asserts. That is to say, if we know the logical syntax of any sign language, then all the propositions of logic are already given.
6.125 It is possible, even in the old logic, to give at the outset a de- scription of all true logical propositions.
80
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
6.1251 Hence there can never be surprises in logic.
6.126 Whether a proposition belongs to logic can be determined by determining the logical properties of the symbol.
And this we do when we prove a logical proposition. For without troubling ourselves about a sense and a meaning, we form the logical propositions out of others by mere symbolic
rules.
We prove a logical proposition by creating it out of other logical propositions by applying in succession certain operations, which again generate tautologies out of the rst. (And from a tautology only tautologies follow.)
Naturally this way of showing that its propositions are tau- tologies is quite unessential to logic. Because the propositions, from which the proof starts, must show without proof that they are tautologies.
6.1261 In logic process and result are equivalent. (Therefore no sur- prises.)
6.1262 Proof in logic is only a mechanical expedient to facilitate the recognition of tautology, where it is complicated.
6.1263 It would be too remarkable, if one could prove a signicant prop- osition logically from another, and a logical proposition also. It is clear from the beginning that the logical proof of a signicant proposition and the proof in logic must be two quite dierent
things.
6.1264 The signicant proposition asserts something, and its proof shows that it is so; in logic every proposition is the form of a proof.
Every proposition of logic is a modus ponens presented in signs. (And the modus ponens can not be expressed by a prop- osition.)
6.1265 Logic can always be conceived to be such that every proposition is its own proof.
6.127 All propositions of logic are of equal rank; there are not some which are essentially primitive and others deduced from these.
Every tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.
81
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
6.1271 It is clear that the number of primitive propositions of logic is arbitrary, for we could deduce logic from one primitive prop- osition by simply forming, for example, the logical product of Frege's primitive propositions. (Frege would perhaps say that this would no longer be immediately self-evident. But it is re- markable that so exact a thinker as Frege should have appealed to the degree of self-evidence as the criterion of a logical propo- sition.)
6.13 Logic is not a theory but a reexion of the world.
Logic is transcendental.
6.2 Mathematics is a logical method.
The propositions of mathematics are equations, and there- fore pseudo-propositions.
6.21 Mathematical propositions express no thoughts.
6.211 In life it is never a mathematical proposition which we need, but we use mathematical propositions only in order to infer from propositions which do not belong to mathematics to others which equally do not belong to mathematics.
(In philosophy the question Why do we really use that word, that proposition? constantly leads to valuable results.)
6.22 The logic of the world which the propositions of logic show in tautologies, mathematics shows in equations.
6.23 If two expressions are connected by the sign of equality, this means that they can be substituted for one another. But whether this is the case must show itself in the two expressions themselves.
It characterizes the logical form of two expressions, that they can be substituted for one another.
6.231 It is a property of armation that it can be conceived as double denial.
It is a property of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 that it can be conceived as
(1 + 1) + (1 + 1).
6.232 Frege says that these expressions have the same meaning but dierent senses.
But what is essential about equation is that it is not neces-
82
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
sary in order to show that both expressions, which are connected by the sign of equality, have the same meaning: for this can be perceived from the two expressions themselves.
6.2321 And, that the propositions of mathematics can be proved means nothing else than that their correctness can be seen without our having to compare what they express with the facts as regards correctness.
6.2322 The identity of the meaning of two expressions cannot be as-
serted. For in order to be able to assert anything about their meaning, I must know their meaning, and if I know their mean- ing, I know whether they mean the same or something dierent.
6.2323 The equation characterizes only the standpoint from which I consider the two expressions, that is to say the standpoint of their equality of meaning.
6.233 To the question whether we need intuition for the solution of mathematical problems it must be answered that language itself here supplies the necessary intuition.
6.2331 The process of calculation brings about just this intuition.
Calculation is not an experiment.
6.234 Mathematics is a method of logic.
6.2341 The essential of mathematical method is working with equa- tions. On this method depends the fact that every proposition of mathematics must be self-intelligible.
6.24 The method by which mathematics arrives at its equations is the method of substitution.
For equations express the substitutability of two expressions, and we proceed from a number of equations to new equations, replacing expressions by others in accordance with the equations.
6.241 Thus the proof of the proposition 2 ×2 = 4 runs:
(Ων)µ′x= Ων×µ′x Def.
Ω2×2′x= (Ω2)2′x= (Ω2)1+1′x= Ω2′Ω2′x= Ω1+1′Ω1+1′x
= (Ω′Ω)′(Ω′Ω)′x= Ω′Ω′Ω′Ω′x= Ω1+1+1+1′x= Ω4′x.
6.3 Logical research means the investigation of all regularity. And
outside logic all is accident.
83
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
6.31 The so-called law of induction cannot in any case be a logical law, for it is obviously a signicant proposition.And therefore it cannot be a law a priori either.
6.32 The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law.*
6.321 Law of Causality is a class name. And as in mechanics there are, for instance, minimum-laws, such as that of least action, so in physics there are causal laws, laws of the causality form.
6.3211 Men had indeed an idea that there must be a law of least ac- tion, before they knew exactly how it ran. (Here, as always, the a priori certain proves to be something purely logical.)
6.33 We do not believe a priori in a law of conservation, but we know
a priori the possibility of a logical form.
6.34 All propositions, such as the law of causation, the law of continu- ity in nature, the law of least expenditure in nature, etc. etc., all these are a priori intuitions of possible forms of the propositions of science.
6.341 Newtonian mechanics, for example, brings the description of the universe to a unied form. Let us imagine a white surface with irregular black spots. We now say: Whatever kind of picture these make I can always get as near as I like to its description, if I cover the surface with a suciently ne square network and now say of every square that it is white or black. In this way I shall have brought the description of the surface to a unied form. This form is arbitrary, because I could have applied with equal success a net with a triangular or hexagonal mesh. It can happen that the description would have been simpler with the aid of a triangular mesh; that is to say we might have described the surface more accurately with a triangular, and coarser, than with the ner square mesh, or vice versa, and so on. To the dierent networks correspond dierent systems of describing the world. Mechanics determine a form of description by saying: All propositions in the description of the world must be obtained in a given way from a number of given propositionsthe mechanical axioms. It thus provides the bricks for building the edice of science, and says: Whatever building thou wouldst erect, thou
84
*I.e. not the form of one particular law, but of any law of a certain sort (B. R.).
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
shalt construct it in some manner with these bricks and these alone.
(As with the system of numbers one must be able to write down any arbitrary number, so with the system of mechanics one must be able to write down any arbitrary physical proposition.)
6.342 And now we see the relative position of logic and mechanics. (We could construct the network out of gures of dierent kinds, as out of triangles and hexagons together.) That a picture like that instanced above can be described by a network of a given form asserts nothing about the picture. (For this holds of every picture of this kind.) But this does characterize the picture, the
fact, namely, that it can be completely described by a denite
net of denite neness.
So too the fact that it can be described by Newtonian me- chanics asserts nothing about the world; but this asserts some- thing, namely, that it can be described in that particular way in which it is described, as is indeed the case. The fact, too, that it can be described more simply by one system of mechanics than by another says something about the world.
6.343 Mechanics is an attempt to construct according to a single plan all true propositions which we need for the description of the
world.
6.3431 Through the whole apparatus of logic the physical laws still speak of the objects of the world.
6.3432 We must not forget that the description of the world by me- chanics is always quite general. There is, for example, never any mention of particular material points in it, but always only of
some points or other.
6.35 Although the spots in our picture are geometrical gures, ge- ometry can obviously say nothing about their actual form and position. But the network is purely geometrical, and all its prop-
erties can be given a priori.
Laws, like the law of causation, etc., treat of the network and not of what the network described.
6.36 If there were a law of causality, it might run: There are natural laws.
85
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
But that can clearly not be said: it shows itself.
6.361 In the terminology of Hertz we might say: Only uniform con-
nexions are thinkable.
6.3611 We cannot compare any process with the passage of time there is no such thingbut only with another process (say, with the movement of the chronometer).
Hence the description of the temporal sequence of events is only possible if we support ourselves on another process.
It is exactly analogous for space. When, for example, we say that neither of two events (which mutually exclude one another) can occur, because there is no cause why the one should occur rather than the other, it is really a matter of our being unable to describe one of the two events unless there is some sort of asymmetry. And if there is such an asymmetry, we can regard
this as the cause of the occurrence of the one and of the non- occurrence of the other.
6.36111 The Kantian problem of the right and left hand which cannot be made to cover one another already exists in the plane, and even in one-dimensional space; where the two congruent gures
a and b cannot be made to cover one another without moving them out of this space. The right and left hand are in fact completely congruent. And the fact that they cannot be made to cover one another has nothing to do with it.
A right-hand glove could be put on a left hand if it could be turned round in four-dimensional space.
6.362 What can be described can happen too, and what is excluded by the law of causality cannot be described.
6.363 The process of induction is the process of assuming the simplest
law that can be made to harmonize with our experience.
6.3631 This process, however, has no logical foundation but only a psy- chological one.
It is clear that there are no grounds for believing that the simplest course of events will really happen.
86
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
6.36311 That the sun will rise to-morrow, is an hypothesis; and that means that we do not know whether it will rise.
6.37 A necessity for one thing to happen because another has hap- pened does not exist. There is only logical necessity.
6.371 At the basis of the whole modern view of the world lies the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena.
6.372 So people stop short at natural laws as at something unassail- able, as did the ancients at God and Fate.
And they both are right and wrong. But the ancients were clearer, in so far as they recognized one clear conclusion, whereas in the modern system it should appear as though everything were
explained.
6.373 The world is independent of my will.
6.374 Even if everything we wished were to happen, this would only be, so to speak, a favour of fate, for there is no logical connexion between will and world, which would guarantee this, and the assumed physical connexion itself we could not again will.
6.375 As there is only a logical necessity, so there is only a logical
impossibility.
6.3751 For two colours, e.g. to be at one place in the visual eld, is impossible, logically impossible, for it is excluded by the logical structure of colour.
Let us consider how this contradiction presents itself in phys- ics. Somewhat as follows: That a particle cannot at the same time have two velocities, i.e. that at the same time it cannot be
in two places, i.e. that particles in dierent places at the same time cannot be identical.
(It is clear that the logical product of two elementary prop- ositions can neither be a tautology nor a contradiction. The as- sertion that a point in the visual eld has two dierent colours at the same time, is a contradiction.)
6.4 All propositions are of equal value.
6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. In it there
is no valueand if there were, it would be of no value.
87
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
If there is a value which is of value, it must lie outside all happening and being-so. For all happening and being-so is ac- cidental.
What makes it non-accidental cannot lie in the world, for
otherwise this would again be accidental.
It must lie outside the world.
6.42 Hence also there can be no ethical propositions.
Propositions cannot express anything higher.
6.421 It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed.
Ethics are transcendental.
(Ethics and æsthetics are one.)
6.422 The rst thought in setting up an ethical law of the form thou shalt . . . is: And what if I do not do it. But it is clear that ethics has nothing to do with punishment and reward in the ordinary sense. This question as to the consequences of an action must therefore be irrelevant. At least these consequences will not be events. For there must be something right in that formulation of the question. There must be some sort of ethical reward and ethical punishment, but this must lie in the action itself.
(And this is clear also that the reward must be something acceptable, and the punishment something unacceptable.)
6.423 Of the will as the bearer of the ethical we cannot speak.
And the will as a phenomenon is only of interest to psychol- ogy.
6.43 If good or bad willing changes the world, it can only change the limits of the world, not the facts; not the things that can be expressed in language.
In brief, the world must thereby become quite another. It must so to speak wax or wane as a whole.
The world of the happy is quite another than that of the unhappy.
6.431 As in death, too, the world does not change, but ceases.
6.4311 Death is not an event of life. Death is not lived through.
If by eternity is understood not endless temporal duration but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present.
88
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
Our life is endless in the way that our visual eld is without limit.
6.4312 The temporal immortality of the soul of man, that is to say, its eternal survival also after death, is not only in no way guaran- teed, but this assumption in the rst place will not do for us what we always tried to make it do. Is a riddle solved by the fact that I survive for ever? Is this eternal life not as enigmatic as our present one? The solution of the riddle of life in space and time lies outside space and time.
(It is not problems of natural science which have to be solved.)
6.432 How the world is, is completely indierent for what is higher. God does not reveal himself in the world.
6.4321 The facts all belong only to the task and not to its performance.
6.44 Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.
6.45 The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni is its contem- plation as a limited whole.
The feeling of the world as a limited whole is the mystical feeling.
6.5 For an answer which cannot be expressed the question too can- not be expressed.
The riddle does not exist.
If a question can be put at all, then it can also be answered.
6.51 Scepticism is not irrefutable, but palpably senseless, if it would doubt where a question cannot be asked.
For doubt can only exist where there is a question; a question only where there is an answer, and this only where something
can be said.
6.52 We feel that even if all possible scientic questions be answered, the problems of life have still not been touched at all. Of course there is then no question left, and just this is the answer.
6.521 The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of this problem.
(Is not this the reason why men to whom after long doubting
89
TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS
the sense of life became clear, could not then say wherein this sense consisted?)
6.522 There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the
mystical.
6.53 The right method of philosophy would be this. To say nothing except what can be said, i.e. the propositions of natural science,
i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy: and then always, when someone else wished to say something metaphys- ical, to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain signs in his propositions. This method would be un- satisfying to the otherhe would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophybut it would be the only strictly correct method.
6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me nally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)
He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly.
7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.

Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung
VORWORT
Dieses Buch wird vielleicht nur der verstehen, der die Gedanken, die darin ausgedrückt sindoder doch ähnliche Gedankenschon selbst ein- mal gedacht hat.Es ist also kein Lehrbuch.Sein Zweck wäre erreicht, wenn es Einem, der es mit Verständnis liest Vergnügen bereitete. Das Buch behandelt die philosophischen Probleme und zeigtwie ich glaubedass die Fragestellung dieser Probleme auf dem Missverständ- nis der Logik unserer Sprache beruht. Man könnte den ganzen Sinn des Buches etwa in die Worte fassen: Was sich überhaupt sagen lässt, lässt sich klar sagen; und wovon man nicht reden kann, darüber muss man schweigen. Das Buch will also dem Denken eine Grenze ziehen, oder vielmehr nicht dem Denken, sondern dem Ausdruck der Gedanken: Denn um dem Denken eine Grenze zu ziehen, müssten wir beide Seiten dieser Grenze denken können (wir müssten also denken können, was sich nicht denken lässt). Die Grenze wird also nur in der Sprache gezogen werden können und was jenseits der Grenze liegt, wird einfach Unsinn sein. Wieweit meine Bestrebungen mit denen anderer Philosophen zusam- menfallen, will ich nicht beurteilen. Ja, was ich hier geschrieben habe macht im Einzelnen überhaupt nicht den Anspruch auf Neuheit; und darum gebe ich auch keine Quellen an, weil es mir gleichgültig ist, ob das was ich gedacht habe, vor mir schon ein anderer gedacht hat. Nur das will ich erwähnen, dass ich den grossartigen Werken Freges und den Arbeiten meines Freundes Herrn Bertrand Russell einen grossen Teil der Anregung zu meinen Gedanken schulde. Wenn diese Arbeit einen Wert hat, so besteht er in Zweierlei. Erstens darin, dass in ihr Gedanken ausgedrückt sind, und dieser Wert wird umso grösser sein, je besser die Gedanken ausgedrückt sind. Je mehr der Nagel auf den Kopf getroen ist.Hier bin ich mir bewusst, weit hinter dem Möglichen zurückgeblieben zu sein. Einfach darum, weil meine Kraft zur
91
Bewältigung der Aufgabe zu gering ist.Mögen andere kommen und es besser machen. Dagegen scheint mir die Wa h r h e i t der hier mitgeteilten Gedanken unantastbar und denitiv. Ich bin also der Meinung, die Probleme im Wesentlichen endgültig gelöst zu haben. Und wenn ich mich hierin nicht irre, so besteht nun der Wert dieser Arbeit zweitens darin, dass sie zeigt, wie wenig damit getan ist, dass diese Probleme gelöst sind.

LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
(Etwas Logisches kann nicht nur-möglich sein. Die Logik han- delt von jeder Möglichkeit und alle Möglichkeiten sind ihre Tat- sachen.)
Wie wir uns räumliche Gegenstände überhaupt nicht aus- serhalb des Raumes, zeitliche nicht ausserhalb der Zeit denken können, so können wir uns k e i n e n Gegenstand ausserhalb der Möglichkeit seiner Verbindung mit anderen denken.
Wenn ich mir den Gegenstand im Verbande des Sachverhalts denken kann, so kann ich ihn nicht ausserhalb der M ö g l i c h - k e i t dieses Verbandes denken.
2.0122 Das Ding ist selbständig, insofern es in allen m ö g l i c h e n Sach- lagen vorkommen kann, aber diese Form der Selbständigkeit ist eine Form des Zusammenhangs mit dem Sachverhalt, eine Form der Unselbständigkeit. (Es ist unmöglich, dass Worte in zwei verschiedenen Weisen auftreten, allein und im Satz.)
2.0123 Wenn ich den Gegenstand kenne, so kenne ich auch sämtliche Möglichkeiten seines Vorkommens in Sachverhalten.
(Jede solche Möglichkeit muss in der Natur des Gegenstandes liegen.)
Es kann nicht nachträglich eine neue Möglichkeit gefunden werden.
2.01231 Um einen Gegenstand zu kennen, muss ich zwar nicht seine externenaber ich muss alle seine internen Eigenschaften ken- nen.
2.0124 Sind alle Gegenstände gegeben, so sind damit auch alle m ö g - l i c h e n Sachverhalte gegeben.
2.013 Jedes Ding ist, gleichsam, in einem Raume möglicher Sachver- halte. Diesen Raum kann ich mir leer denken, nicht aber das Ding ohne den Raum.
2.0131 Der räumliche Gegenstand muss im unendlichen Raume liegen. (Der Raumpunkt ist eine Argumentstelle.)
Der Fleck im Gesichtsfeld muss zwar nicht rot sein, aber eine Farbe muss er haben: er hat sozusagen den Farbenraum um sich. Der Ton muss e i n e Höhe haben, der Gegenstand des Tastsinnes e i n e Härte usw.
94
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
2.014 Die Gegenstände enthalten die Möglichkeit aller Sachlagen.
2.0141 Die Möglichkeit seines Vorkommens in Sachverhalten, ist die Form des Gegenstandes.
2.02 Der Gegenstand ist einfach.
2.0201 Jede Aussage über Komplexe lässt sich in eine Aussage über deren Bestandteile und in diejenigen Sätze zerlegen, welche die Komplexe vollständig beschreiben.
2.021 Die Gegenstände bilden die Substanz der Welt. Darum können sie nicht zusammengesetzt sein.
2.0211 Hätte die Welt keine Substanz, so würde, ob ein Satz Sinn hat, davon abhängen, ob ein anderer Satz wahr ist.
2.0212 Es wäre dann unmöglich, ein Bild der Welt (wahr oder falsch) zu entwerfen.
2.022 Es ist oenbar, dass auch eine von der wirklichen noch so ver- schieden gedachte Welt Etwaseine Formmit der wirklichen gemein haben muss.
2.023 Diese feste Form besteht eben aus den Gegenständen.
2.0231 Die Substanz der Welt ka n n nur eine Form und keine materiel- len Eigenschaften bestimmen. Denn diese werden erst durch die Sätze dargestellterst durch die Konguration der Gegenstände gebildet.
2.0232 Beiläug gesprochen: Die Gegenstände sind farblos.
2.0233 Zwei Gegenstände von der gleichen logischen Form sindabge- sehen von ihren externen Eigenschaftenvon einander nur da- durch unterschieden, dass sie verschieden sind.
2.02331 Entweder ein Ding hat Eigenschaften, die kein anderes hat, dann kann man es ohneweiteres durch eine Beschreibung aus den an- deren herausheben, und darauf hinweisen; oder aber, es gibt mehrere Dinge, die ihre sämtlichen Eigenschaften gemeinsam haben, dann ist es überhaupt unmöglich auf eines von ihnen zu zeigen.
Denn, ist das Ding durch nichts hervorgehoben, so kann ich es nicht hervorheben, denn sonst ist es eben hervorgehoben.
95
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
2.024 Die Substanz ist das, was unabhängig von dem was der Fall ist, besteht.
2.025 Sie ist Form und Inhalt.
2.0251 Raum, Zeit und Farbe (Färbigkeit) sind Formen der Gegenstän- de.
2.026 Nur wenn es Gegenstände gibt, kann es eine feste Form der Welt geben.
2.027 Das Feste, das Bestehende und der Gegenstand sind Eins.
2.0271 Der Gegenstand ist das Feste, Bestehende; die Konguration ist das Wechselnde, Unbeständige.
2.0272 Die Konguration der Gegenstände bildet den Sachverhalt.
2.03 Im Sachverhalt hängen die Gegenstände ineinander, wie die Glie- der einer Kette.
2.031 Im Sachverhalt verhalten sich die Gegenstände in bestimmter Art und Weise zueinander.
2.032 Die Art und Weise, wie die Gegenstände im Sachverhalt zusam- menhängen, ist die Struktur des Sachverhaltes.
2.033 Die Form ist die Möglichkeit der Struktur.
2.034 Die Struktur der Tatsache besteht aus den Strukturen der Sach- verhalte.
2.04 Die Gesamtheit der bestehenden Sachverhalte ist die Welt.
2.05 Die Gesamtheit der bestehenden Sachverhalte bestimmt auch, welche Sachverhalte nicht bestehen.
2.06 Das Bestehen und Nichtbestehen von Sachverhalten ist die Wirk- lichkeit.
(Das Bestehen von Sachverhalten nennen wir auch eine po- sitive, das Nichtbestehen eine negative Tatsache.)
2.061 Die Sachverhalte sind von einander unabhängig.
2.062 Aus dem Bestehen oder Nichtbestehen eines Sachverhaltes kann nicht auf das Bestehen oder Nichtbestehen eines anderen ge- schlossen werden.
2.063 Die gesamte Wirklichkeit ist die Welt.
96
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
2.1 Wir machen uns Bilder der Tatsachen.
2.11 Das Bild stellt die Sachlage im logischen Raume, das Bestehen und Nichtbestehen von Sachverhalten vor.
2.12 Das Bild ist ein Modell der Wirklichkeit.
2.13 Den Gegenständen entsprechen im Bilde die Elemente des Bil- des.
2.131 Die Elemente des Bildes vertreten im Bild die Gegenstände.
2.14 Das Bild besteht darin, dass sich seine Elemente in bestimmter Art und Weise zu einander verhalten.
2.141 Das Bild ist eine Tatsache.
2.15 Dass sich die Elemente des Bildes in bestimmter Art und Wei- se zu einander verhalten stellt vor, dass sich die Sachen so zu einander verhalten.
Dieser Zusammenhang der Elemente des Bildes heisse seine Struktur und ihre Möglichkeit seine Form der Abbildung.
2.151 Die Form der Abbildung ist die Möglichkeit, dass sich die Dinge so zu einander verhalten, wie die Elemente des Bildes.
2.1511 Das Bild ist s o mit der Wirklichkeit verknüpft; es reicht bis zu ihr.
2.1512 Es ist wie ein Massstab an die Wirklichkeit angelegt.
2.15121 Nur die äussersten Punkte der Teilstriche b e r ü h r e n den zu messenden Gegenstand.
2.1513 Nach dieser Auassung gehört also zum Bilde auch noch die abbildende Beziehung, die es zum Bild macht.
2.1514 Die abbildende Beziehung besteht aus den Zuordnungen der Ele- mente des Bildes und der Sachen.
2.1515 Diese Zuordnungen sind gleichsam die Fühler der Bildelemente, mit denen das Bild die Wirklichkeit berührt.
2.16 Die Tatsache muss um Bild zu sein, etwas mit dem Abgebildeten gemeinsam haben.
2.161 In Bild und Abgebildetem muss etwas identisch sein, damit das eine überhaupt ein Bild des anderen sein kann.
97
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
2.17 Was das Bild mit der Wirklichkeit gemein haben muss, um sie auf seine Art und Weiserichtig oder falschabbilden zu kön- nen, ist seine Form der Abbildung.
2.171 Das Bild kann jede Wirklichkeit abbilden, deren Form es hat.
Das räumliche Bild alles Räumliche, das farbige alles Farbige, etc.
2.172 Seine Form der Abbildung aber, kann das Bild nicht abbilden; es weist sie auf.
2.173 Das Bild stellt sein Objekt von ausserhalb dar (sein Standpunkt ist seine Form der Darstellung), darum stellt das Bild sein Ob- jekt richtig oder falsch dar.
2.174 Das Bild kann sich aber nicht ausserhalb seiner Form der Dar- stellung stellen.
2.18 Was jedes Bild, welcher Form immer, mit der Wirklichkeit ge- mein haben muss, um sie überhauptrichtig oder falschab- bilden zu können, ist die logische Form, das ist, die Form der Wirklichkeit.
2.181 Ist die Form der Abbildung die logische Form, so heisst das Bild das logische Bild.
2.182 Jedes Bild ist a u c h ein logisches. (Dagegen ist z. B. nicht jedes Bild ein räumliches.)
2.19 Das logische Bild kann die Welt abbilden.
2.2 Das Bild hat mit dem Abgebildeten die logische Form der Ab- bildung gemein.
2.201 Das Bild bildet die Wirklichkeit ab, indem es eine Möglichkeit des Bestehens und Nichtbestehens von Sachverhalten darstellt.
2.202 Das Bild stellt eine mögliche Sachlage im logischen Raume dar.
2.203 Das Bild enthält die Möglichkeit der Sachlage, die es darstellt.
2.21 Das Bild stimmt mit der Wirklichkeit überein oder nicht; es ist richtig oder unrichtig, wahr oder falsch.
2.22 Das Bild stellt dar, was es darstellt, unabhängig von seiner Wahr- oder Falschheit, durch die Form der Abbildung.
2.221 Was das Bild darstellt, ist sein Sinn.
98
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
2.222 In der Übereinstimmung oder Nichtübereinstimmung seines Sin- nes mit der Wirklichkeit, besteht seine Wahrheit oder Falschheit.
2.223 Um zu erkennen, ob das Bild wahr oder falsch ist, müssen wir es mit der Wirklichkeit vergleichen.
2.224 Aus dem Bild allein ist nicht zu erkennen, ob es wahr oder falsch ist.
2.225 Ein a priori wahres Bild gibt es nicht.
3 Das logische Bild der Tatsachen ist der Gedanke.
3.001 Ein Sachverhalt ist denkbar heisst: Wir können uns ein Bild von ihm machen.
3.01 Die Gesamtheit der wahren Gedanken sind ein Bild der Welt.
3.02 Der Gedanke enthält die Möglichkeit der Sachlage die er denkt. Was denkbar ist, ist auch möglich.
3.03 Wir können nichts Unlogisches denken, weil wir sonst unlogisch denken müssten.
3.031 Man sagte einmal, dass Gott alles schaen könne, nur nichts, was den logischen Gesetzen zuwider wäre.Wir könnten näm- lich von einer unlogischen Welt nicht s a g e n, wie sie aussähe.
3.032 Etwas der Logik widersprechendes in der Sprache darstellen, kann man ebensowenig, wie in der Geometrie eine den Geset- zen des Raumes widersprechende Figur durch ihre Koordinaten darstellen; oder die Koordinaten eines Punktes angeben, welcher nicht existiert.
3.0321 Wohl können wir einen Sachverhalt räumlich darstellen, welcher den Gesetzen der Physik, aber keinen, der den Gesetzen der Geometrie zuwiderliefe.
3.04 Ein a priori richtiger Gedanke wäre ein solcher, dessen Möglich- keit seine Wahrheit bedingte.
3.05 Nur so könnten wir a priori wissen, dass ein Gedanke wahr ist, wenn aus dem Gedanken selbst (ohne Vergleichsobjekt) seine Wahrheit zu erkennen wäre.
3.1 Im Satz drückt sich der Gedanke sinnlich wahrnehmbar aus.
3.11 Wir benützen das sinnlich wahrnehmbare Zeichen (Laut- oder
99
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Schriftzeichen etc.) des Satzes als Projektion der möglichen Sachlage.
Die Projektionsmethode ist das Denken des Satz-Sinnes.
3.12 Das Zeichen, durch welches wir den Gedanken ausdrücken, nenne ich das Satzzeichen. Und der Satz ist das Satzzeichen in seiner projektiven Beziehung zur Welt.
3.13 Zum Satz gehört alles, was zur Projektion gehört; aber nicht das Projizierte.
Also die Möglichkeit des Projizierten, aber nicht dieses selbst.
Im Satz ist also sein Sinn noch nicht enthalten, wohl aber die Möglichkeit ihn auszudrücken.
(Der Inhalt des Satzes heisst der Inhalt des sinnvollen Sat- zes.)
Im Satz ist die Form seines Sinnes enthalten, aber nicht des- sen Inhalt.
3.14 Das Satzzeichen besteht darin, dass sich seine Elemente, die Wörter, in ihm auf bestimmte Art und Weise zu einander ver- halten.
Das Satzzeichen ist eine Tatsache.
3.141 Der Satz ist kein Wörtergemisch.(Wie das musikalische The- ma kein Gemisch von Tönen.)
Der Satz ist artikuliert.
3.142 Nur Tatsachen können einen Sinn ausdrücken, eine Klasse von Namen kann es nicht.
3.143 Dass das Satzzeichen eine Tatsache ist, wird durch die gewöhn- liche Ausdrucksform der Schrift oder des Druckes verschleiert.
Denn im gedruckten Satz z. B. sieht das Satzzeichen nicht wesentlich verschieden aus vom Wort.
(So war es möglich, dass Frege den Satz einen zusammenge- setzten Namen nannte.)
3.1431 Sehr klar wird das Wesen des Satzzeichens, wenn wir es uns, statt aus Schriftzeichen, aus räumlichen Gegenständen (etwa Tischen, Stühlen, Büchern) zusammengesetzt denken.
Die gegenseitige räumliche Lage dieser Dinge drückt dann den Sinn des Satzes aus.
100
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
3.1432 Nicht: Das komplexe Zeichen aRb` sagt, dass a in der Bezie-
hung R zu bsteht, sondern: D a s s a in einer gewissen Bezie-
hung zu b steht, sagt, d a s s aRb.
3.144 Sachlagen kann man beschreiben, nicht b e n e n n e n.
(Namen gleichen Punkten, Sätze Pfeilen, sie haben Sinn.)
3.2 Im Satze kann der Gedanke so ausgedrückt sein, dass den Gegen- ständen des Gedankens Elemente des Satzzeichens entsprechen.
3.201 Diese Elemente nenne ich einfache Zeichen und den Satz voll- ständig analysiert.
3.202 Die im Satze angewandten einfachen Zeichen heissen Namen.
3.203 Der Name bedeutet den Gegenstand. Der Gegenstand ist seine Bedeutung. (A ist dasselbe Zeichen wie A.)
3.21 Der Konguration der einfachen Zeichen im Satzzeichen ent- spricht die Konguration der Gegenstände in der Sachlage.
3.22 Der Name vertritt im Satz den Gegenstand.
3.221 Die Gegenstände kann ich nur n e n n e n. Zeichen vertreten sie. Ich kann nur v o n ihnen sprechen, s i e a u s s p r e c h e n kann ich nicht. Ein Satz kann nur sagen, w i e ein Ding ist, nicht w a s es ist.
3.23 Die Forderung der Möglichkeit der einfachen Zeichen ist die For- derung der Bestimmtheit des Sinnes.
3.24 Der Satz, welcher vom Komplex handelt, steht in interner Be- ziehung zum Satze, der von dessen Bestandteil handelt.
Der Komplex kann nur durch seine Beschreibung gegeben sein, und diese wird stimmen oder nicht stimmen. Der Satz, in welchem von einem Komplex die Rede ist, wird, wenn dieser nicht existiert, nicht unsinnig, sondern einfach falsch sein.
Dass ein Satzelement einen Komplex bezeichnet, kann man aus einer Unbestimmtheit in den Sätzen sehen, worin es vor- kommt. Wir w i s s e n, durch diesen Satz ist noch nicht alles bestimmt. (Die Allgemeinheitsbezeichnung e n t h ä l t ja ein Ur- bild.)
Die Zusammenfassung des Symbols eines Komplexes in ein einfaches Symbol kann durch eine Denition ausgedrückt wer- den.
101
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
3.25 Es gibt eine und nur eine vollständige Analyse des Satzes.
3.251 Der Satz drückt auf bestimmte, klar angebbare Weise aus, was er ausdrückt: Der Satz ist artikuliert.
3.26 Der Name ist durch keine Denition weiter zu zergliedern: er ist ein Urzeichen.
3.261 Jedes denierte Zeichen bezeichnet ü b e r jene Zeichen, durch welche es deniert wurde; und die Denitionen weisen den Weg.
Zwei Zeichen, ein Urzeichen, und ein durch Urzeichen de- niertes, können nicht auf dieselbe Art und Weise bezeichnen. Namen ka n n man nicht durch Denitionen auseinanderlegen. (Kein Zeichen, welches allein, selbständig eine Bedeutung hat.)
3.262 Was in den Zeichen nicht zum Ausdruck kommt, das zeigt ih- re Anwendung. Was die Zeichen verschlucken, das spricht ihre Anwendung aus.
3.263 Die Bedeutungen von Urzeichen können durch Erläuterungen erklärt werden. Erläuterungen sind Sätze, welche die Urzeichen enthalten. Sie können also nur verstanden werden, wenn die Be- deutungen dieser Zeichen bereits bekannt sind.
3.3 Nur der Satz hat Sinn; nur im Zusammenhange des Satzes hat ein Name Bedeutung.
3.31 Jeden Teil des Satzes, der seinen Sinn charakterisiert, nenne ich einen Ausdruck (ein Symbol).
(Der Satz selbst ist ein Ausdruck.)
Ausdruck ist alles, für den Sinn des Satzes wesentliche, was Sätze miteinander gemein haben können.
Der Ausdruck kennzeichnet eine Form und einen Inhalt.
3.311 Der Ausdruck setzt die Formen aller Sätze voraus, in welchen er vorkommen kann. Er ist das gemeinsame charakteristische Merkmal einer Klasse von Sätzen.
3.312 Er wird also dargestellt durch die allgemeine Form der Sätze, die er charakterisiert.
Und zwar wird in dieser Form der Ausdruck k o n s t a n t und alles übrige va r i a b e l sein.
3.313 Der Ausdruck wird also durch eine Variable dargestellt, deren Werte die Sätze sind, die den Ausdruck enthalten.
102
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
(Im Grenzfall wird die Variable zur Konstanten, der Aus- druck zum Satz.)
Ich nenne eine solche Variable Satzvariable.
3.314 Der Ausdruck hat nur im Satz Bedeutung. Jede Variable lässt sich als Satzvariable auassen.
(Auch der variable Name.)
3.315 Verwandeln wir einen Bestandteil eines Satzes in eine Variable, so gibt es eine Klasse von Sätzen, welche sämtlich Werte des so entstandenen variablen Satzes sind. Diese Klasse hängt im allgemeinen noch davon ab, was wir, nach willkürlicher Über- einkunft, mit Teilen jenes Satzes meinen. Verwandeln wir aber alle jene Zeichen, deren Bedeutung willkürlich bestimmt wurde, in Variable, so gibt es nun noch immer eine solche Klasse. Die- se aber ist nun von keiner Übereinkunft abhängig, sondern nur noch von der Natur des Satzes. Sie entspricht einer logischen Formeinem logischen Urbild.
3.316 Welche Werte die Satzvariable annehmen darf, wird festgesetzt.
Die Festsetzung der Werte i s t die Variable.
3.317 Die Festsetzung der Werte der Satzvariablen ist die A n g a b e d e r S ä t z e, deren gemeinsames Merkmal die Variable ist.
Die Festsetzung ist eine Beschreibung dieser Sätze.
Die Festsetzung wird also nur von Symbolen, nicht von deren Bedeutung handeln.
Und d a s n u r B e s c h r e i b u n g B e z e i c h n e t e v o n S y m b o l e n dies ist der Festsetzung wesentlich, i s t d a s s u n d n i c h t s ü b e r s i e n u r e i n e a u s s a g t.
Wie die Beschreibung der Sätze geschieht, ist unwesentlich.
3.318 Den Satz fasse ichwie Frege und Russellals Funktion der in ihm enthaltenen Ausdrücke auf.
3.32 Das Zeichen ist das sinnlich Wahrnehmbare am Symbol.
3.321 Zwei verschiedene Symbole können also das Zeichen (Schrift- zeichen oder Lautzeichen etc.) miteinander gemein habensie bezeichnen dann auf verschiedene Art und Weise.
3.322 Es kann nie das gemeinsame Merkmal zweier Gegenstände an- zeigen, dass wir sie mit demselben Zeichen, aber durch zwei
103
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
verschiedene B e z e i c h n u n g s w e i s e n bezeichnen. Denn das Zeichen ist ja willkürlich. Man könnte also auch zwei verschiede- ne Zeichen wählen, und wo bliebe dann das Gemeinsame in der Bezeichnung.
3.323 In der Umgangssprache kommt es ungemein häug vor, dass dasselbe Wort auf verschiedene Art und Weise bezeichnetalso verschiedenen Symbolen angehört, oder, dass zwei Wörter, die auf verschiedene Art und Weise bezeichnen, äusserlich in der gleichen Weise im Satze angewandt werden.
So erscheint das Wort ist als Kopula, als Gleichheitszei- chen und als Ausdruck der Existenz; existieren als intransiti- ves Zeitwort wie gehen; identisch als Eigenschaftswort; wir reden von E t w a s, aber auch davon, dass e t w a s geschieht.
(Im Satze Grün ist grünwo das erste Wort ein Perso- nenname, das letzte ein Eigenschaftswort isthaben diese Wor- te nicht einfach verschiedene Bedeutung, sondern es sind v e r - s c h i e d e n e S y m b o l e.)
3.324 So entstehen leicht die fundamentalsten Verwechslungen (deren die ganze Philosophie voll ist).
3.325 Um diesen Irrtümern zu entgehen, müssen wir eine Zeichen- sprache verwenden, welche sie ausschliesst, indem sie nicht das gleiche Zeichen in verschiedenen Symbolen, und Zeichen, welche auf verschiedene Art bezeichnen, nicht äusserlich auf die gleiche Art verwendet. Eine Zeichensprache also, die der l o g i s c h e n Grammatikder logischen Syntaxgehorcht.
(Die Begrisschrift Frege's und Russell's ist eine solche Spra- che, die allerdings noch nicht alle Fehler ausschliesst.)
3.326 Um das Symbol am Zeichen zu erkennen, muss man auf den sinnvollen Gebrauch achten.
3.327 Das Zeichen bestimmt erst mit seiner logisch-syntaktischen Ver- wendung zusammen eine logische Form.
3.328 Wird ein Zeichen n i c h t g e b r a u c h t, so ist es bedeutungslos. Das ist der Sinn der Devise Occams.
(Wenn sich alles so verhält als hätte ein Zeichen Bedeutung, dann hat es auch Bedeutung.)
104
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
3.33 In der logischen Syntax darf nie die Bedeutung eines Zeichens eine Rolle spielen; sie muss sich aufstellen lassen, ohne dass dabei von der B e d e u t u n g eines Zeichens die Rede wäre, sie darf n u r die Beschreibung der Ausdrücke voraussetzen.
3.331 Von dieser Bemerkung sehen wir in Russell's Theory of types hinüber: Der Irrtum Russell's zeigt sich darin, dass er bei der Aufstellung der Zeichenregeln von der Bedeutung der Zeichen reden musste.
3.332 Kein Satz kann etwas über sich selbst aussagen, weil das Satzzei- chen nicht in sich selbst enthalten sein kann, (das ist die ganze Theory of types).
3.333 Eine Funktion kann darum nicht ihr eigenes Argument sein, weil das Funktionszeichen bereits das Urbild seines Arguments ent- hält und es sich nicht selbst enthalten kann.
Nehmen wir nämlich an, die Funktion F(fx) könnte ihr ei- genes Argument sein; dann gäbe es also einen Satz: F(F(fx))
und in diesem müssen die äussere Funktion F und die innere
Funktion F verschiedene Bedeutungen haben, denn die innere hat die Form ϕ(fx), die äussere, die Form ψ(ϕ(fx)). Gemein-
sam ist den beiden Funktionen nur der Buchstabe F, der aber
allein nichts bezeichnet.
Dies wird sofort klar, wenn wir statt F(F(u)) schreiben
(∃ϕ) : F(ϕu) .ϕu= Fu.
Hiermit erledigt sich Russell's Paradox.
3.334 Die Regeln der logischen Syntax müssen sich von selbst verste- hen, wenn man nur weiss, wie ein jedes Zeichen bezeichnet.
3.34 Der Satz besitzt wesentliche und zufällige Züge.
Zufällig sind die Züge, die von der besonderen Art der Her- vorbringung des Satzzeichens herrühren. Wesentlich diejenigen, welche allein den Satz befähigen, seinen Sinn auszudrücken.
3.341 Das Wesentliche am Satz ist also das, was allen Sätzen, welche den gleichen Sinn ausdrücken können, gemeinsam ist.
Und ebenso ist allgemein das Wesentliche am Symbol das, was alle Symbole, die denselben Zweck erfüllen können, gemein- sam haben.
105
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
3.3411 Man könnte also sagen: Der eigentliche Name ist das, was alle Symbole, die den Gegenstand bezeichnen, gemeinsam haben. Es würde sich so successive ergeben, dass keinerlei Zusammenset- zung für den Namen wesentlich ist.
3.342 An unseren Notationen ist zwar etwas willkürlich, aber d a s ist nicht willkürlich: Dass, w e n n wir etwas willkürlich bestimmt haben, dann etwas anderes der Fall sein muss. (Dies hängt von dem We s e n der Notation ab.)
3.3421 Eine besondere Bezeichnungsweise mag unwichtig sein, aber wichtig ist es immer, dass diese eine m ö g l i c h e Bezeichnungs- weise ist. Und so verhält es sich in der Philosophie überhaupt: Das Einzelne erweist sich immer wieder als unwichtig, aber die Möglichkeit jedes Einzelnen gibt uns einen Aufschluss über das Wesen der Welt.
3.343 Denitionen sind Regeln der Übersetzung von einer Sprache in eine andere. Jede richtige Zeichensprache muss sich in jede an- dere nach solchen Regeln übersetzen lassen: D i e s ist, was sie alle gemeinsam haben.
3.344 Das, was am Symbol bezeichnet, ist das Gemeinsame aller jener Symbole, durch die das erste den Regeln der logischen Syntax zufolge ersetzt werden kann.
3.3441 Man kann z. B. das Gemeinsame aller Notationen für die Wahr- heitsfunktionen so ausdrücken: Es ist ihnen gemeinsam, dass sich allez. B.durch die Notation von ∼p (nicht p) und p∨q
(p oder q) e r s e t z e n l a s s e n.
(Hiermit ist die Art und Weise gekennzeichnet, wie eine spezielle mögliche Notation uns allgemeine Aufschlüsse geben kann.)
3.3442 Das Zeichen des Komplexes löst sich auch bei der Analyse nicht willkürlich auf, so dass etwa seine Auösung in jedem Satzgefüge eine andere wäre.
3.4 Der Satz bestimmt einen Ort im logischen Raum. Die Existenz dieses logischen Ortes ist durch die Existenz der Bestandteile allein verbürgt, durch die Existenz des sinnvollen Satzes.
3.41 Das Satzzeichen und die logischen Koordinaten: Das ist der lo- gische Ort.
106
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
3.411 Der geometrische und der logische Ort stimmen darin überein, dass beide die Möglichkeit einer Existenz sind.
3.42 Obwohl der Satz nur einen Ort des logischen Raumes bestimmen darf, so muss doch durch ihn schon der ganze logische Raum gegeben sein.
(Sonst würden durch die Verneinung, die logische Summe, das logische Produkt, etc. immer neue Elementein Koordina- tioneingeführt.)
(Das logische Gerüst um das Bild herum bestimmt den logi- schen Raum. Der Satz durchgreift den ganzen logischen Raum.)
3.5 Das angewandte, gedachte, Satzzeichen ist der Gedanke.
4 Der Gedanke ist der sinnvolle Satz.
4.001 Die Gesamtheit der Sätze ist die Sprache.
4.002 Der Mensch besitzt die Fähigkeit Sprachen zu bauen, womit sich jeder Sinn ausdrücken lässt, ohne eine Ahnung davon zu haben, wie und was jedes Wort bedeutet.Wie man auch spricht, ohne zu wissen, wie die einzelnen Laute hervorgebracht werden.
Die Umgangssprache ist ein Teil des menschlichen Organis- mus und nicht weniger kompliziert als dieser.
Es ist menschenunmöglich, die Sprachlogik aus ihr unmittel- bar zu entnehmen.
Die Sprache verkleidet den Gedanken. Und zwar so, dass man nach der äusseren Form des Kleides, nicht auf die Form des bekleideten Gedankens schliessen kann; weil die äussere Form des Kleides nach ganz anderen Zwecken gebildet ist, als danach, die Form des Körpers erkennen zu lassen.
Die stillschweigenden Abmachungen zum Verständnis der Umgangssprache sind enorm kompliziert.
4.003 Die meisten Sätze und Fragen, welche über philosophische Din- ge geschrieben worden sind, sind nicht falsch, sondern unsinnig. Wir können daher Fragen dieser Art überhaupt nicht beantwor- ten, sondern nur ihre Unsinnigkeit feststellen. Die meisten Fra- gen und Sätze der Philosophen beruhen darauf, dass wir unsere Sprachlogik nicht verstehen.
(Sie sind von der Art der Frage, ob das Gute mehr oder weniger identisch sei als das Schöne.)
107
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Und es ist nicht verwunderlich, dass die tiefsten Probleme eigentlich k e i n e Probleme sind.
4.0031 Alle Philosophie ist Sprachkritik. (Allerdings nicht im Sinne Mauthners.) Russell's Verdienst ist es, gezeigt zu haben, dass die scheinbare logische Form des Satzes nicht seine wirkliche sein muss.
4.01 Der Satz ist ein Bild der Wirklichkeit.
Der Satz ist ein Modell der Wirklichkeit, so wie wir sie uns denken.
4.011 Auf den ersten Blick scheint der Satzwie er etwa auf dem Papier gedruckt stehtkein Bild der Wirklichkeit zu sein, von der er handelt. Aber auch die Notenschrift scheint auf den ers- ten Blick kein Bild der Musik zu sein, und unsere Lautzeichen- (Buchstaben-)Schrift kein Bild unserer Lautsprache.
Und doch erweisen sich diese Zeichensprachen auch im ge- wöhnlichen Sinne als Bilder dessen, was sie darstellen.
4.012 Oenbar ist, dass wir einen Satz von der Form aRb als Bild empnden. Hier ist das Zeichen oenbar ein Gleichnis des Be- zeichneten.
4.013 Und wenn wir in das Wesentliche dieser Bildhaftigkeit eindrin- gen, so sehen wir, dass dieselbe durch s c h e i n b a r e U n r e - g e l m ä s s i g k e i t e n (wie die Verwendung der ♯ und ♭ in der
Notenschrift) n i c h t gestört wird.
Denn auch diese Unregelmässigkeiten bilden das ab, was sie ausdrücken sollen; nur auf eine andere Art und Weise.
4.014 Die Grammophonplatte, der musikalische Gedanke, die Noten- schrift, die Schallwellen, stehen alle in jener abbildenden inter- nen Beziehung zu einander, die zwischen Sprache und Welt be- steht.
Ihnen allen ist der logische Bau gemeinsam.
(Wie im Märchen die zwei Jünglinge, ihre zwei Pferde und ihre Lilien. Sie sind alle in gewissem Sinne Eins.)
4.0141 Dass es eine allgemeine Regel gibt, durch die der Musiker aus der Partitur die Symphonie entnehmen kann, durch welche man aus der Linie auf der Grammophonplatte die Symphonie und
108
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
nach der ersten Regel wieder die Partitur ableiten kann, dar- in besteht eben die innere Ähnlichkeit dieser scheinbar so ganz verschiedenen Gebilde. Und jene Regel ist das Gesetz der Pro- jektion, welches die Symphonie in die Notensprache projiziert. Sie ist die Regel der Übersetzung der Notensprache in die Spra- che der Grammophonplatte.
4.015 Die Möglichkeit aller Gleichnisse, der ganzen Bildhaftigkeit un- serer Ausdrucksweise, ruht in der Logik der Abbildung.
4.016 Um das Wesen des Satzes zu verstehen, denken wir an die Hiero- glyphenschrift, welche die Tatsachen die sie beschreibt abbildet.
Und aus ihr wurde die Buchstabenschrift, ohne das Wesent- liche der Abbildung zu verlieren.
4.02 Dies sehen wir daraus, dass wir den Sinn des Satzzeichens ver- stehen, ohne dass er uns erklärt wurde.
4.021 Der Satz ist ein Bild der Wirklichkeit: Denn ich kenne die von ihm dargestellte Sachlage, wenn ich den Satz verstehe. Und den Satz verstehe ich, ohne dass mir sein Sinn erklärt wurde.
4.022 Der Satz z e i g t seinen Sinn.
Der Satz z e i g t, wie es sich verhält, w e n n er wahr ist. Und er s a g t, d a s s es sich so verhält.
4.023 Die Wirklichkeit muss durch den Satz auf ja oder nein xiert sein.
Dazu muss sie durch ihn vollständig beschrieben werden.
Der Satz ist die Beschreibung eines Sachverhaltes.
Wie die Beschreibung einen Gegenstand nach seinen exter- nen Eigenschaften, so beschreibt der Satz die Wirklichkeit nach ihren internen Eigenschaften.
Der Satz konstruiert eine Welt mit Hilfe eines logischen Ge- rüstes und darum kann man am Satz auch sehen, wie sich al- les Logische verhält, w e n n er wahr ist. Man kann aus einem falschen Satz S c h l ü s s e z i e h e n.
4.024 Einen Satz verstehen, heisst, wissen was der Fall ist, wenn er wahr ist.
(Man kann ihn also verstehen, ohne zu wissen, ob er wahr ist.)
109
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Man versteht ihn, wenn man seine Bestandteile versteht.
4.025 Die Übersetzung einer Sprache in eine andere geht nicht so vor sich, dass man jeden S a t z der einen in einen S a t z der anderen übersetzt, sondern nur die Satzbestandteile werden übersetzt.
(Und das Wörterbuch übersetzt nicht nur Substantiva, son- dern auch Zeit-, Eigenschafts- und Bindewörter etc.; und es be- handelt sie alle gleich.)
4.026 Die Bedeutungen der einfachen Zeichen (der Wörter) müssen uns erklärt werden, dass wir sie verstehen.
Mit den Sätzen aber verständigen wir uns.
4.027 Es liegt im Wesen des Satzes, dass er uns einen n e u e n Sinn mitteilen kann.
4.03 Ein Satz muss mit alten Ausdrücken einen neuen Sinn mitteilen.
Der Satz teilt uns eine Sachlage mit, also muss er w e s e n t - l i c h mit der Sachlage zusammenhängen.
Und der Zusammenhang ist eben, dass er ihr logisches Bild
ist.
Der Satz sagt nur insoweit etwas aus, als er ein Bild ist.
4.031 Im Satz wird gleichsam eine Sachlage probeweise zusammenge- stellt.
Man kann geradezu sagen: statt, dieser Satz hat diesen und diesen Sinn; dieser Satz stellt diese und diese Sachlage dar.
4.0311 Ein Name steht für ein Ding, ein anderer für ein anderes Ding und untereinander sind sie verbunden, so stellt das Ganzewie ein lebendes Bildden Sachverhalt vor.
4.0312 Die Möglichkeit des Satzes beruht auf dem Prinzip der Vertre- tung von Gegenständen durch Zeichen.
Mein Grundgedanke ist, dass die logischen Konstanten nicht vertreten. Dass sich die L o g i k der Tatsachen nicht ver- treten lässt.
4.032 Nur insoweit ist der Satz ein Bild einer Sachlage, als er logisch gegliedert ist.
(Auch der Satz ambulo ist zusammengesetzt, denn sein Stamm ergibt mit einer anderen Endung und seine Endung mit einem anderen Stamm, einen anderen Sinn.)
110
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
4.04 Am Satz muss gerade soviel zu unterscheiden sein, als an der Sachlage die er darstellt.
Die beiden müssen die gleiche logische (mathematische) Mannigfaltigkeit besitzen. (Vergleiche Hertz's Mechanik, über Dynamische Modelle.)
4.041 Diese mathematische Mannigfaltigkeit kann man natürlich nicht selbst wieder abbilden. Aus ihr kann man beim Abbilden nicht heraus.
4.0411 Wollten wir z. B. das, was wir durch (x)fx ausdrücken, durch
Vorsetzen eines Indexes vor fx ausdrückenetwa so: Alg.
fx, es würde nicht genügenwir wüssten nicht, was verallge- meinert wurde. Wollten wir es durch einen Index a anzeigen
etwa so: f(xa)es würde auch nicht genügenwir wüssten nicht den Bereich der Allgemeinheitsbezeichnung.
Wollten wir es durch Einführung einer Marke in die Argu- mentstellen versuchenetwa so: (A,A) .F(A,A)es würde nicht genügenwir könnten die Identität der Variablen nicht feststellen. U.s.w.
Alle diese Bezeichnungsweisen genügen nicht, weil sie nicht die notwendige mathematische Mannigfaltigkeit haben.
4.0412 Aus demselben Grunde genügt die idealistische Erklärung des Sehens der räumlichen Beziehungen durch die Raumbrille nicht, weil sie nicht die Mannigfaltigkeit dieser Beziehungen erklären kann.
4.05 Die Wirklichkeit wird mit dem Satz verglichen.
4.06 Nur dadurch kann der Satz wahr oder falsch sein, indem er ein Bild der Wirklichkeit ist.
4.061 Beachtet man nicht, dass der Satz einen von den Tatsachen un- abhängigen Sinn hat, so kann man leicht glauben, dass wahr und falsch gleichberechtigte Beziehungen von Zeichen und Bezeich- netem sind.
Man könnte dann z. B. sagen, dass p auf die wahre Art
bezeichnet, was ∼p auf die falsche Art, etc.
4.062 Kann man sich nicht mit falschen Sätzen, wie bisher mit wahren, verständigen? Solange man nur weiss, dass sie falsch gemeint
111
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
sind. Nein! Denn, wahr ist ein Satz, wenn es sich so verhält, wie wir es durch ihn sagen; und wenn wir mit p∼p meinen,
und es sich so verhält wie wir es meinen, so ist p in der neuen
Auassung wahr und nicht falsch.
4.0621 Dass aber die Zeichen p und ∼p das gleiche sagen k ö n - n e n, ist wichtig. Denn es zeigt, dass dem Zeichen ∼ in der
Wirklichkeit nichts entspricht.
Dass in einem Satz die Verneinung vorkommt, ist noch kein Merkmal seines Sinnes (∼∼p= p).
Die Sätze p und ∼p haben entgegengesetzten Sinn, aber es entspricht ihnen eine und dieselbe Wirklichkeit.
4.063 Ein Bild zur Erklärung des Wahrheitsbegries: Schwarzer Fleck auf weissem Papier; die Form des Fleckes kann man beschreiben, indem man für jeden Punkt der Fläche angibt, ob er weiss oder schwarz ist. Der Tatsache, dass ein Punkt schwarz ist, entspricht eine positiveder, dass ein Punkt weiss (nicht schwarz) ist, eine negative Tatsache. Bezeichne ich einen Punkt der Fläche (einen Frege'schen Wahrheitswert), so entspricht dies der Annahme, die zur Beurteilung aufgestellt wird, etc. etc.
Um aber sagen zu können, ein Punkt sei schwarz oder weiss, muss ich vorerst wissen, wann man einen Punkt schwarz und wann man ihn weiss nennt; um sagen zu können: p ist wahr (oder falsch), muss ich bestimmt haben, unter welchen Umstän- den ich p wahr nenne, und damit bestimme ich den Sinn des
Satzes.
Der Punkt an dem das Gleichnis hinkt ist nun der: Wir kön- nen auf einen Punkt des Papiers zeigen, auch ohne zu wissen, was weiss und schwarz ist; einem Satz ohne Sinn aber entspricht gar nichts, denn er bezeichnet kein Ding (Wahrheitswert) dessen Ei- genschaften etwa falsch oder wahr hiessen; das Verbum eines Satzes ist nicht ist wahr oder ist falschwie Frege glaubte, sondern das, was wahr ist muss das Verbum schon enthalten.
4.064 Jeder Satz muss s c h o n einen Sinn haben; die Bejahung kann ihn ihm nicht geben, denn sie bejaht ja gerade den Sinn. Und dasselbe gilt von der Verneinung, etc.
4.0641 Man könnte sagen: Die Verneinung bezieht sich schon auf den logischen Ort, den der verneinte Satz bestimmt.
112
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Der verneinende Satz bestimmt einen a n d e r e n logischen Ort als der verneinte.
Der verneinende Satz bestimmt einen logischen Ort mit Hilfe des logischen Ortes des verneinten Satzes, indem er jenen aus- serhalb diesem liegend beschreibt.
Dass man den verneinten Satz wieder verneinen kann, zeigt schon, dass das, was verneint wird, schon ein Satz und nicht erst die Vorbereitung zu einem Satze ist.
4.1 Der Satz stellt das Bestehen und Nichtbestehen der Sachverhalte dar.
4.11 Die Gesamtheit der wahren Sätze ist die gesamte Naturwissen- schaft (oder die Gesamtheit der Naturwissenschaften).
4.111 Die Philosophie ist keine der Naturwissenschaften.
(Das Wort Philosophie muss etwas bedeuten, was über oder unter, aber nicht neben den Naturwissenschaften steht.)
4.112 Der Zweck der Philosophie ist die logische Klärung der Gedan- ken.
Die Philosophie ist keine Lehre, sondern eine Tätigkeit.
Ein philosophisches Werk besteht wesentlich aus Erläuterun- gen.
Das Resultat der Philosophie sind nicht philosophische Sät- ze, sondern das Klarwerden von Sätzen.
Die Philosophie soll die Gedanken, die sonst, gleichsam, trü- be und verschwommen sind, klar machen und scharf abgrenzen.
4.1121 Die Psychologie ist der Philosophie nicht verwandter als irgend eine andere Naturwissenschaft.
Erkenntnistheorie ist die Philosophie der Psychologie.
Entspricht nicht mein Studium der Zeichensprache dem Stu- dium der Denkprozesse, welches die Philosophen für die Philo- sophie der Logik für so wesentlich hielten? Nur verwickelten sie sich meistens in unwesentliche psychologische Untersuchungen und eine analoge Gefahr gibt es auch bei meiner Methode.
4.1122 Die Darwinsche Theorie hat mit der Philosophie nicht mehr zu schaen, als irgend eine andere Hypothese der Naturwissen- schaft.
113
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
4.113 Die Philosophie begrenzt das bestreitbare Gebiet der Naturwis- senschaft.
4.114 Sie soll das Denkbare abgrenzen und damit das Undenkbare.
Sie soll das Undenkbare von innen durch das Denkbare be- grenzen.
4.115 Sie wird das Unsagbare bedeuten, indem sie das Sagbare klar darstellt.
4.116 Alles was überhaupt gedacht werden kann, kann klar gedacht werden. Alles was sich aussprechen lässt, lässt sich klar ausspre- chen.
4.12 Der Satz kann die gesamte Wirklichkeit darstellen, aber er kann nicht das darstellen, was er mit der Wirklichkeit gemein haben muss, um sie darstellen zu könnendie logische Form.
Um die logische Form darstellen zu können, müssten wir uns mit dem Satze ausserhalb der Logik aufstellen können, das heisst ausserhalb der Welt.
4.121 Der Satz kann die logische Form nicht darstellen, sie spiegelt sich in ihm.
Was sich in der Sprache spiegelt, kann sie nicht darstellen.
Was s i c h in der Sprache ausdrückt, können w i r nicht durch sie ausdrücken.
Der Satz z e i g t die logische Form der Wirklichkeit.
Er weist sie auf.
4.1211 So zeigt ein Satz fa, dass in seinem Sinn der Gegenstand a
vorkommt, zwei Sätze fa und ga, dass in ihnen beiden von demselben Gegenstand die Rede ist.
Wenn zwei Sätze einander widersprechen, so zeigt dies ihre Struktur; ebenso, wenn einer aus dem anderen folgt. U.s.w.
4.1212 Was gezeigt werden ka n n, ka n n nicht gesagt werden.
4.1213 Jetzt verstehen wir auch unser Gefühl: dass wir im Besitze einer richtigen logischen Auassung seien, wenn nur einmal alles in unserer Zeichensprache stimmt.
4.122 Wir können in gewissem Sinne von formalen Eigenschaften der Gegenstände und Sachverhalte bezw. von Eigenschaften der
114
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Struktur der Tatsachen reden und in demselben Sinne von for- malen Relationen und Relationen von Strukturen.
(Statt Eigenschaft der Struktur sage ich auch interne Eigen- schaft; statt Relation der Strukturen interne Relation.
Ich führe diese Ausdrücke ein, um den Grund der, bei den Philosophen sehr verbreiteten Verwechslung zwischen den inter- nen Relationen und den eigentlichen (externen) Relationen zu zeigen.)
Das Bestehen solcher interner Eigenschaften und Relationen kann aber nicht durch Sätze behauptet werden, sondern es zeigt sich in den Sätzen, welche jene Sachverhalte darstellen und von jenen Gegenständen handeln.
4.1221 Eine interne Eigenschaft einer Tatsache können wir auch einen Zug dieser Tatsache nennen. (In dem Sinn, in welchem wir etwa von Gesichtszügen sprechen.)
4.123 Eine Eigenschaft ist intern, wenn es undenkbar ist, dass ihr Ge- genstand sie nicht besitzt.
(Diese blaue Farbe und jene stehen in der internen Relation von heller und dunkler eo ipso. Es ist undenkbar, dass d i e s e beiden Gegenstände nicht in dieser Relation stünden.)
(Hier entspricht dem schwankenden Gebrauch der Worte Ei- genschaft und Relation der schwankende Gebrauch des Wor- tes Gegenstand.)
4.124 Das Bestehen einer internen Eigenschaft einer möglichen Sach- lage wird nicht durch einen Satz ausgedrückt, sondern es drückt sich in dem sie darstellenden Satz, durch eine interne Eigenschaft dieses Satzes aus.
Es wäre ebenso unsinnig, dem Satze eine formale Eigenschaft zuzusprechen, als sie ihm abzusprechen.
4.1241 Formen kann man nicht dadurch von einander unterscheiden, dass man sagt, die eine habe diese, die andere aber jene Eigen- schaft; denn dies setzt voraus, dass es einen Sinn habe, beide Eigenschaften von beiden Formen auszusagen.
4.125 Das Bestehen einer internen Relation zwischen möglichen Sach- lagen drückt sich sprachlich durch eine interne Relation zwischen den sie darstellenden Sätzen aus.
115
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
4.1251 Hier erledigt sich nun die Streitfrage ob alle Relationen intern oder extern seien.
4.1252 Reihen, welche durch i n t e r n e Relationen geordnet sind, nenne ich Formenreihen.
Die Zahlenreihe ist nicht nach einer externen, sondern nach einer internen Relation geordnet.
Ebenso die Reihe der Sätze aRb, (∃x) : aRx . xRb,
(∃x,y) : aRx.xRy.yRb, u. s. f.
(Steht bin einer dieser Beziehungen zu a, so nenne ich beinen
Nachfolger von a.)
4.126 In dem Sinne, in welchem wir von formalen Eigenschaften spre- chen, können wir nun auch von formalen Begrien reden.
(Ich führe diesen Ausdruck ein, um den Grund der Verwechs- lung der formalen Begrie mit den eigentlichen Begrien, welche die ganze alte Logik durchzieht, klar zu machen.)
Dass etwas unter einen formalen Begri als dessen Gegen- stand fällt, kann nicht durch einen Satz ausgedrückt werden. Sondern es zeigt sich an dem Zeichen dieses Gegenstandes selbst. (Der Name zeigt, dass er einen Gegenstand bezeichnet, das Zah- lenzeichen, dass es eine Zahl bezeichnet etc.)
Die formalen Begrie können ja nicht, wie die eigentlichen Begrie, durch eine Funktion dargestellt werden.
Denn ihre Merkmale, die formalen Eigenschaften, werden nicht durch Funktionen ausgedrückt.
Der Ausdruck der formalen Eigenschaft ist ein Zug gewisser Symbole.
Das Zeichen der Merkmale eines formalen Begries ist al- so ein charakteristischer Zug aller Symbole, deren Bedeutungen unter den Begri fallen.
Der Ausdruck des formalen Begries also, eine Satzvariable, in welcher nur dieser charakteristische Zug konstant ist.
4.127 Die Satzvariable bezeichnet den formalen Begri und ihre Werte die Gegenstände, welche unter diesen Begri fallen.
4.1271 Jede Variable ist das Zeichen eines formalen Begries.
Denn jede Variable stellt eine konstante Form dar, welche
116
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
alle ihre Werte besitzen, und die als formale Eigenschaft dieser Werte aufgefasst werden kann.
4.1272 So ist der variable Name x das eigentliche Zeichen des Schein-
begries G e g e n s t a n d.
Wo immer das Wort Gegenstand (Ding, Sache, etc.) richtig gebraucht wird, wird es in der Begrisschrift durch den variablen Namen ausgedrückt.
Zum Beispiel in dem Satz es gibt 2 Gegenstände, welche . . . durch (∃x,y)....
Wo immer es anders, also als eigentliches Begriswort ge- braucht wird, entstehen unsinnige Scheinsätze.
So kann man z. B. nicht sagen Es gibt Gegenstände, wie man etwa sagt Es gibt Bücher. Und ebenso wenig Es gibt 100 Gegenstände, oder Es gibt ℵ0 Gegenstände.
Und es ist unsinnig, von der A n z a h l a l l e r G e g e n s t ä n - d e zu sprechen.
Dasselbe gilt von den Worten Komplex, Tatsache, Funk- tion, Zahl, etc.
Sie alle bezeichnen formale Begrie und werden in der Be- grisschrift durch Variable, nicht durch Funktionen oder Klassen dargestellt. (Wie Frege und Russell glaubten.)
Ausdrücke wie 1 ist eine Zahl, es gibt nur Eine Null und alle ähnlichen sind unsinnig.
(Es ist ebenso unsinnig zu sagen es gibt nur eine 1, als es unsinnig wäre, zu sagen: 2 + 2 ist um 3 Uhr gleich 4.)
4.12721 Der formale Begri ist mit einem Gegenstand, der unter ihn fällt, bereits gegeben. Man kann also nicht Gegenstände eines forma- len Begries u n d den formalen Begri selbst als Grundbegrie einführen. Man kann also z. B. nicht den Begri der Funktion, und auch spezielle Funktionen (wie Russell) als Grundbegrie einführen; oder den Begri der Zahl und bestimmte Zahlen.
4.1273 Wollen wir den allgemeinen Satz: b ist ein Nachfolger von a
in der Begrisschrift ausdrücken, so brauchen wir hierzu einen Ausdruck für das allgemeine Glied der Formenreihe: aRb, (∃x) :
aRx.xRb, (∃x,y) : aRx.xRy.yRb, . . . Das allgemeine Glied einer Formenreihe kann man nur durch eine Variable ausdrücken, denn
117
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
der Begri: Glied dieser Formenreihe, ist ein f o r m a l e r Begri. (Dies haben Frege und Russell übersehen; die Art und Weise wie sie allgemeine Sätze, wie den obigen ausdrücken wollen ist daher falsch; sie enthält einen circulus vitiosus.)
Wir können das allgemeine Glied der Formenreihe bestim- men, indem wir ihr erstes Glied angeben und die allgemeine Form der Operation, welche das folgende Glied aus dem vorher- gehenden Satz erzeugt.
4.1274 Die Frage nach der Existenz eines formalen Begries ist unsinnig. Denn kein Satz kann eine solche Frage beantworten.
(Man kann also z. B. nicht fragen: Gibt es unanalysierbare Subjekt-Prädikatsätze?)
4.128 Die logischen Formen sind zahl l o s.
Darum gibt es in der Logik keine ausgezeichneten Zahlen und darum gibt es keinen philosophischen Monismus oder Dualismus, etc.
4.2 Der Sinn des Satzes ist seine Übereinstimmung, und Nichtüber- einstimmung mit den Möglichkeiten des Bestehens und Nicht- bestehens der Sachverhalte.
4.21 Der einfachste Satz, der Elementarsatz, behauptet das Bestehen eines Sachverhaltes.
4.211 Ein Zeichen des Elementarsatzes ist es, dass kein Elementarsatz mit ihm in Widerspruch stehen kann.
4.22 Der Elementarsatz besteht aus Namen. Er ist ein Zusammen- hang, eine Verkettung, von Namen.
4.221 Es ist oenbar, dass wir bei der Analyse der Sätze auf Elemen- tarsätze kommen müssen, die aus Namen in unmittelbarer Ver- bindung bestehen.
Es frägt sich hier, wie kommt der Satzverband zustande.
4.2211 Auch wenn die Welt unendlich komplex ist, so dass jede Tatsache aus unendlich vielen Sachverhalten besteht und jeder Sachver- halt aus unendlich vielen Gegenständen zusammengesetzt ist, auch dann müsste es Gegenstände und Sachverhalte geben.
4.23 Der Name kommt im Satz nur im Zusammenhange des Elemen- tarsatzes vor.
118
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
4.24 Die Namen sind die einfachen Symbole, ich deute sie durch ein- zelne Buchstaben (x, y, z) an.
Den Elementarsatz schreibe ich als Funktion der Namen in der Form: fx, ϕ(x,y), etc.
Oder ich deute ihn durch die Buchstaben p, q, r an.
4.241 Gebrauche ich zwei Zeichen in ein und derselben Bedeutung, so drücke ich dies aus, indem ich zwischen beide das Zeichen =
setze.
a= b heisst also: das Zeichen a ist durch das Zeichen b
ersetzbar.
(Führe ich durch eine Gleichung ein neues Zeichen b ein,
indem ich bestimme, es solle ein bereits bekanntes Zeichen a er- setzen, so schreibe ich die GleichungDenition(wie Russell) in der Form a= b Def.. Die Denition ist eine Zeichenregel.)
4.242 Ausdrücke von der Form a= b sind also nur Behelfe der Dar- stellung; sie sagen nichts über die Bedeutung der Zeichen a,
b aus.
4.243 Können wir zwei Namen verstehen, ohne zu wissen, ob sie das- selbe Ding oder zwei verschiedene Dinge bezeichnen?Können wir einen Satz, worin zwei Namen vorkommen, verstehen, ohne zu wissen, ob sie Dasselbe oder Verschiedenes bedeuten?
Kenne ich etwa die Bedeutung eines englischen und eines gleichbedeutenden deutschen Wortes, so ist es unmöglich, dass ich nicht weiss, dass die beiden gleichbedeutend sind; es ist un- möglich, dass ich sie nicht ineinander übersetzen kann.
Ausdrücke wie a = a, oder von diesen abgeleitete, sind weder Elementarsätze, noch sonst sinnvolle Zeichen. (Dies wird sich später zeigen.)
4.25 Ist der Elementarsatz wahr, so besteht der Sachverhalt; ist der Elementarsatz falsch, so besteht der Sachverhalt nicht.
4.26 Die Angabe aller wahren Elementarsätze beschreibt die Welt vollständig. Die Welt ist vollständig beschrieben durch die An- gaben aller Elementarsätze plus der Angabe, welche von ihnen wahr und welche falsch sind.

Es können alle Kombinationen der Sachverhalte bestehen, die andern nicht bestehen.
4.28 Diesen Kombinationen entsprechen ebenso viele Möglichkeiten der Wahrheitund Falschheitvon n Elementarsätzen.
4.3 Die Wahrheitsmöglichkeiten der Elementarsätze bedeuten die Möglichkeiten des Bestehens und Nichtbestehens der Sachver- halte.
4.31 Die Wahrheitsmöglichkeiten können wir durch Schemata folgen- der Art darstellen (W bedeutet wahr, F, falsch. Die Rei- hen der W und F unter der Reihe der Elementarsätze bedeu- ten in leichtverständlicher Symbolik deren Wahrheitsmöglichkei- ten):

4.4 Der Satz ist der Ausdruck der Übereinstimmung und Nichtüber- einstimmung mit den Wahrheitsmöglichkeiten der Elementarsät- ze.
4.41 Die Wahrheitsmöglichkeiten der Elementarsätze sind die Bedin- gungen der Wahrheit und Falschheit der Sätze.
4.411 Es ist von vornherein wahrscheinlich, dass die Einführung der Elementarsätze für das Verständnis aller anderen Satzarten grundlegend ist. Ja, das Verständnis der allgemeinen Sätze hängt f ü h l b a r von dem der Elementarsätze ab.

120
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
4.43 Die Übereinstimmung mit den Wahrheitsmöglichkeiten können wir dadurch ausdrücken, indem wir ihnen im Schema etwa das Abzeichen W (wahr) zuordnen.
Das Fehlen dieses Abzeichens bedeutet die Nichtübereinstim- mung.
4.431 Der Ausdruck der Übereinstimmung und Nichtübereinstimmung mit den Wahrheitsmöglichkeiten der Elementarsätze drückt die Wahrheitsbedingungen des Satzes aus.
Der Satz ist der Ausdruck seiner Wahrheitsbedingungen.
(Frege hat sie daher ganz richtig als Erklärung der Zeichen seiner Begrisschrift vorausgeschickt. Nur ist die Erklärung des Wahrheitsbegries bei Frege falsch: Wären das Wahre und das Falsche wirklich Gegenstände und die Argumente in ∼p
etc. dann wäre nach Frege's Bestimmung der Sinn von ∼p kei-
neswegs bestimmt.)
4.44 Das Zeichen, welches durch die Zuordnung jener Abzeichen W und der Wahrheitsmöglichkeiten entsteht, ist ein Satzzeichen.
4.441 Es ist klar, dass dem Komplex der Zeichen F und W kein Gegenstand (oder Komplex von Gegenständen) entspricht; so wenig, wie den horizontalen und vertikalen Strichen oder den Klammern.Logische Gegenstände gibt es nicht.
Analoges gilt natürlich für alle Zeichen, die dasselbe aus- drücken wie die Schemata der W und F.
4.442 Es ist z. B.: p q
W W W
F F W
F W W
W F
ein Satzzeichen.
(Frege's Urteilsstrich ⊢ ist logisch ganz bedeutungslos; er zeigt bei Frege (und Russell) nur an, dass diese Autoren die so bezeichneten Sätze für wahr halten. ⊢ gehört daher ebenso wenig zum Satzgefüge, wie etwa die Nummer des Satzes. Ein Satz kann unmöglich von sich selbst aussagen, dass er wahr ist.)
Ist die Reihenfolge der Wahrheitsmöglichkeiten im Schema
121
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
durch eine Kombinationsregel ein für allemal festgesetzt, dann ist die letzte Kolonne allein schon ein Ausdruck der Wahrheits- bedingungen. Schreiben wir diese Kolonne als Reihe hin, so wird das Satzzeichen zu:
(WWW)(p, q) oder deutlicher (WWFW)(p, q).
(Die Anzahl der Stellen in der linken Klammer ist durch die Anzahl der Glieder in der rechten bestimmt.)
4.45 Für n Elementarsätze gibt es Ln mögliche Gruppen von Wahr-
heitsbedingungen.
Die Gruppen von Wahrheitsbedingungen, welche zu den Wahrheitsmöglichkeiten einer Anzahl von Elementarsätzen ge- hören, lassen sich in eine Reihe ordnen.
4.46 Unter den möglichen Gruppen von Wahrheitsbedingungen gibt es zwei extreme Fälle.
In dem einen Fall ist der Satz für sämtliche Wahrheitsmög- lichkeiten der Elementarsätze wahr. Wir sagen, die Wahrheits- bedingungen sind t a u t o l o g i s c h.
Im zweiten Fall ist der Satz für sämtliche Wahrheitsmöglich- keiten falsch: Die Wahrheitsbedingungen sind k o n t r a d i k t o - r i s c h.
Im ersten Fall nennen wir den Satz eine Tautologie, im zwei- ten Fall eine Kontradiktion.
4.461 Der Satz zeigt was er sagt, die Tautologie und die Kontradiktion, dass sie nichts sagen.
Die Tautologie hat keine Wahrheitsbedingungen, denn sie ist bedingungslos wahr; und die Kontradiktion ist unter keiner Bedingung wahr.
Tautologie und Kontradiktion sind sinnlos.
(Wie der Punkt von dem zwei Pfeile in entgegengesetzter Richtung auseinandergehen.)
(Ich weiss z. B. nichts über das Wetter, wenn ich weiss, dass es regnet oder nicht regnet.)
4.4611 Tautologie und Kontradiktion sind aber nicht unsinnig; sie gehö- ren zum Symbolismus, und zwar ähnlich wie die 0 zum Sym- bolismus der Arithmetik.
122
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
4.462 Tautologie und Kontradiktion sind nicht Bilder der Wirklichkeit. Sie stellen keine mögliche Sachlage dar. Denn jene lässt j e d e mögliche Sachlage zu, diese k e i n e.
In der Tautologie heben die Bedingungen der Übereinstim- mung mit der Weltdie darstellenden Beziehungeneinander auf, so dass sie in keiner darstellenden Beziehung zur Wirklich- keit steht.
4.463 Die Wahrheitsbedingungen bestimmen den Spielraum, der den Tatsachen durch den Satz gelassen wird.
(Der Satz, das Bild, das Modell, sind im negativen Sinne wie ein fester Körper, der die Bewegungsfreiheit der anderen beschränkt; im positiven Sinne, wie der von fester Substanz be- grenzte Raum, worin ein Körper Platz hat.)
Die Tautologie lässt der Wirklichkeit den ganzenunend- lichenlogischen Raum; die Kontradiktion erfüllt den ganzen logischen Raum und lässt der Wirklichkeit keinen Punkt. Keine von beiden kann daher die Wirklichkeit irgendwie bestimmen.
4.464 Die Wahrheit der Tautologie ist gewiss, des Satzes möglich, der Kontradiktion unmöglich.
(Gewiss, möglich, unmöglich: Hier haben wir das Anzeichen jener Gradation, die wir in der Wahrscheinlichkeitslehre brau- chen.)
4.465 Das logische Produkt einer Tautologie und eines Satzes sagt das- selbe, wie der Satz. Also ist jenes Produkt identisch mit dem Satz. Denn man kann das Wesentliche des Symbols nicht än- dern, ohne seinen Sinn zu ändern.
4.466 Einer bestimmten logischen Verbindung von Zeichen entspricht eine bestimmte logische Verbindung ihrer Bedeutungen; j e d e b e l i e b i g e Verbindung entspricht nur den unverbundenen Zei- chen.
Das heisst, Sätze die für jede Sachlage wahr sind, können überhaupt keine Zeichenverbindungen sein, denn sonst könnten ihnen nur bestimmte Verbindungen von Gegenständen entspre- chen.
(Und keiner logischen Verbindung entspricht k e i n e Verbin- dung der Gegenstände.)
123
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Tautologie und Kontradiktion sind die Grenzfälle der Zei- chenverbindung, nämlich ihre Auösung.
4.4661 Freilich sind auch in der Tautologie und Kontradiktion die Zei- chen noch mit einander verbunden, d. h. sie stehen in Bezie- hungen zu einander, aber diese Beziehungen sind bedeutungslos, dem S y m b o l unwesentlich.
4.5 Nun scheint es möglich zu sein, die allgemeinste Satzform anzu- geben: das heisst, eine Beschreibung der Sätze i r g e n d e i n e r Zeichensprache zu geben, so dass jeder mögliche Sinn durch ein Symbol, auf welches die Beschreibung passt, ausgedrückt wer- den kann, und dass jedes Symbol, worauf die Beschreibung passt, einen Sinn ausdrücken kann, wenn die Bedeutungen der Namen entsprechend gewählt werden.
Es ist klar, dass bei der Beschreibung der allgemeinsten Satz- form n u r ihr Wesentliches beschrieben werden darf,sonst wäre sie nämlich nicht die allgemeinste.
Dass es eine allgemeine Satzform gibt, wird dadurch bewie- sen, dass es keinen Satz geben darf, dessen Form man nicht hätte voraussehen (d. h. konstruieren) können. Die allgemeine Form des Satzes ist: Es verhält sich so und so.
4.51 Angenommen, mir wären a l l e Elementarsätze gegeben: Dann lässt sich einfach fragen: welche Sätze kann ich aus ihnen bilden. Und das sind a l l e Sätze und s o sind sie begrenzt.
4.52 Die Sätze sind Alles, was aus der Gesamtheit aller Elementar- sätze folgt (natürlich auch daraus, dass es die G e s a m t h e i t a l l e r ist). (So könnte man in gewissem Sinne sagen, dass a l l e Sätze Verallgemeinerungen der Elementarsätze sind.)
4.53 Die allgemeine Satzform ist eine Variable.
5 Der Satz ist eine Wahrheitsfunktion der Elementarsätze.
(Der Elementarsatz ist eine Wahrheitsfunktion seiner selbst.)
5.01 Die Elementarsätze sind die Wahrheitsargumente des Satzes.
5.02 Es liegt nahe, die Argumente von Funktionen mit den Indices von Namen zu verwechseln. Ich erkenne nämlich sowohl am Ar- gument wie am Index die Bedeutung des sie enthaltenden Zei- chens.
124
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
In Russell's +c ist z. B. c ein Index, der darauf hinweist, dass das ganze Zeichen das Additionszeichen für Kardinalzahlen ist. Aber diese Bezeichnung beruht auf willkürlicher Überein- kunft und man könnte statt +c auch ein einfaches Zeichen
wählen; in ∼p aber ist p kein Index, sondern ein Argument:
der Sinn von ∼p ka n n n i c h t verstanden werden, ohne dass vorher der Sinn von p verstanden worden wäre. (Im Namen Julius Cäsar ist Julius ein Index. Der Index ist immer ein Teil einer Beschreibung des Gegenstandes, dessen Namen wir ihn an- hängen. Z. B. D e r Cäsar aus dem Geschlechte der Julier.)
Die Verwechslung von Argument und Index liegt, wenn ich mich nicht irre, der Theorie Frege's von der Bedeutung der Sätze und Funktionen zugrunde. Für Frege waren die Sätze der Logik Namen, und deren Argumente die Indices dieser Namen.
5.1 Die Wahrheitsfunktionen lassen sich in Reihen ordnen.
Das ist die Grundlage der Wahrscheinlichkeitslehre.
5.101 Die Wahrheitsfunktionen jeder Anzahl von Elementarsätzen las- sen sich in einem Schema folgender Art hinschreiben:
(W W W W)(p, q) Tautologie (Wenn p, so p; und wenn q, so q.) (p ⊃p . q ⊃q)
( F W W W)(p, q) in Worten: Nicht beides p und q. (∼(p . q))
(W F W W)(p, q) Wenn q, so p. (q ⊃p)
(W W F W)(p, q) Wenn p, so q. (p ⊃q)
(W W W F )(p, q) p oder q. (p ∨q)
( F F W W)(p, q) Nicht q. (∼q)
( F W F W)(p, q) Nicht p. (∼p)
( F W W F )(p, q) p, oder q, aber nicht beide. (p .∼q : ∨: q .∼p)
(W F F W)(p, q) Wenn p, so q; und wenn q, so p. (p ≡q)
(W F W F )(p, q) p
(W W F F )(p, q) q
( F F F W)(p, q) Weder p noch q. (∼p .∼q) oder (p |q)
( F F W F )(p, q) p und nicht q. (p .∼q)
( F W F F )(p, q) q und nicht p. (q .∼p)
(W F F F )(p, q) q und p. (q . p)
( F F F F )(p, q) Kontradiktion (p und nicht p; und q und nicht q.) (p .∼p . q .∼q)
Diejenigen Wahrheitsmöglichkeiten seiner Wahrheitsargu- mente, welche den Satz bewahrheiten, will ich seine Wa h r - h e i t s g r ü n d e nennen.
5.11 Sind die Wahrheitsgründe, die einer Anzahl von Sätzen gemein- sam sind, sämtlich auch Wahrheitsgründe eines bestimmten Sat-
125
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
zes, so sagen wir, die Wahrheit dieses Satzes folge aus der Wahr- heit jener Sätze.
5.12 Insbesondere folgt die Wahrheit eines Satzes p aus der Wahr-
heit eines anderen q, wenn alle Wahrheitsgründe des zweiten Wahrheitsgründe des ersten sind.
5.121 Die Wahrheitsgründe des einen sind in denen des anderen ent- halten; p folgt aus q.
5.122 Folgt paus q, so ist der Sinn von p im Sinne von q enthalten.
5.123 Wenn ein Gott eine Welt erschat, worin gewisse Sätze wahr sind, so schat er damit auch schon eine Welt, in welcher alle ihre Folgesätze stimmen. Und ähnlich könnte er keine Welt schaen, worin der Satz p wahr ist, ohne seine sämtlichen Gegenstände
zu schaen.
5.124 Der Satz bejaht jeden Satz der aus ihm folgt.
5.1241 p.q ist einer der Sätze, welche p bejahen und zugleich einer
der Sätze, welche q bejahen.
Zwei Sätze sind einander entgegengesetzt, wenn es keinen sinnvollen Satz gibt, der sie beide bejaht.
Jeder Satz der einem anderen widerspricht, verneint ihn.
5.13 Dass die Wahrheit eines Satzes aus der Wahrheit anderer Sätze folgt, ersehen wir aus der Struktur der Sätze.
5.131 Folgt die Wahrheit eines Satzes aus der Wahrheit anderer, so drückt sich dies durch Beziehungen aus, in welchen die Formen jener Sätze zu einander stehen; und zwar brauchen wir sie nicht erst in jene Beziehungen zu setzen, indem wir sie in einem Satze miteinander verbinden, sondern diese Beziehungen sind intern und bestehen, sobald, und dadurch dass, jene Sätze bestehen.
5.1311 Wenn wir von p∨qund ∼pauf qschliessen, so ist hier durch die Bezeichnungsweise die Beziehung der Satzformen von p∨q und
∼p verhüllt. Schreiben wir aber z. B. statt p∨q p|q.|.p|q
und statt ∼p p|p (p|q= weder p, noch q), so wird der innere
Zusammenhang oenbar.
(Dass man aus (x).fxauf faschliessen kann, das zeigt, dass die Allgemeinheit auch im Symbol (x) .fx vorhanden ist.)
126
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
5.132 Folgt paus q, so kann ich von q auf pschliessen; paus q folgern.
Die Art des Schlusses ist allein aus den beiden Sätzen zu entnehmen.
Nur sie selbst können den Schluss rechtfertigen.
Schlussgesetze, welchewie bei Frege und Russelldie Schlüsse rechtfertigen sollen, sind sinnlos, und wären überüs- sig.
5.133 Alles Folgern geschieht a priori.
5.134 Aus einem Elementarsatz lässt sich kein anderer folgern.
5.135 Auf keine Weise kann aus dem Bestehen irgend einer Sachlage auf das Bestehen einer, von ihr gänzlich verschiedenen Sachlage geschlossen werden.
5.136 Einen Kausalnexus, der einen solchen Schluss rechtfertigte, gibt es nicht.
5.1361 Die Ereignisse der Zukunft k ö n n e n wir nicht aus den gegen- wärtigen erschliessen.
Der Glaube an den Kausalnexus ist der A b e r g l a u b e.
5.1362 Die Willensfreiheit besteht darin, dass zukünftige Handlungen jetzt nicht gewusst werden können. Nur dann könnten wir sie wissen, wenn die Kausalität eine i n n e r e Notwendigkeit wäre, wie die des logischen Schlusses.Der Zusammenhang von Wis- sen und Gewusstem, ist der der logischen Notwendigkeit.
(A weiss, dass pder Fall ist ist sinnlos, wenn peine Tauto-
logie ist.)
5.1363 Wenn daraus, dass ein Satz uns einleuchtet, nicht f o l g t, dass er wahr ist, so ist das Einleuchten auch keine Rechtfertigung für unseren Glauben an seine Wahrheit.
5.14 Folgt ein Satz aus einem anderen, so sagt dieser mehr als jener, jener weniger als dieser.
5.141 5.142 Folgt p aus q und q aus p, so sind sie ein und derselbe Satz.
Die Tautologie folgt aus allen Sätzen: sie sagt Nichts.
5.143 Die Kontradiktion ist das Gemeinsame der Sätze, was k e i n Satz mit einem anderen gemein hat. Die Tautologie ist das Gemein- same aller Sätze, welche nichts miteinander gemein haben.
127
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Die Kontradiktion verschwindet sozusagen ausserhalb, die Tautologie innerhalb aller Sätze.
Die Kontradiktion ist die äussere Grenze der Sätze, die Tau- tologie ihr substanzloser Mittelpunkt.
5.15 Ist Wr die Anzahl der Wahrheitsgründe des Satzes r, Wrs die
Anzahl derjenigen Wahrheitsgründe des Satzes s, die zugleich
Wahrheitsgründe von r sind, dann nennen wir das Verhältnis:
Wrs : Wr das Mass der Wa h r s c h e i n l i c h k e i t, welche der
Satz r dem Satz s gibt.
5.151 Sei in einem Schema wie dem obigen in No. 5.101 Wr die Anzahl
der W im Satze r; Wrs die Anzahl derjenigen W im Satze s,
die in gleichen Kolonnen mit W des Satzes r stehen. Der Satz
r gibt dann dem Satze s die Wahrscheinlichkeit: Wrs : Wr.
5.1511 Es gibt keinen besonderen Gegenstand, der den Wahrscheinlich- keitssätzen eigen wäre.
5.152 Sätze, welche keine Wahrheitsargumente mit einander gemein haben, nennen wir von einander unabhängig.
Von einander unabhängige Sätze (z. B. irgend zwei Elemen- tarsätze) geben einander die Wahrscheinlichkeit 1
2 .
Folgt p aus q, so gibt der Satz q dem Satz p die Wahr- scheinlichkeit 1. Die Gewissheit des logischen Schlusses ist ein Grenzfall der Wahrscheinlichkeit.
(Anwendung auf Tautologie und Kontradiktion.)
5.153 Ein Satz ist an sich weder wahrscheinlich noch unwahrscheinlich. Ein Ereignis trit ein, oder es trit nicht ein, ein Mittelding gibt es nicht.
5.154 In einer Urne seien gleichviel weisse und schwarze Kugeln (und keine anderen). Ich ziehe eine Kugel nach der anderen und lege sie wieder in die Urne zurück. Dann kann ich durch den Versuch feststellen, dass sich die Zahlen der gezogenen schwarzen und weissen Kugeln bei fortgesetztem Ziehen einander nähern.
D a s ist also kein mathematisches Faktum.
Wenn ich nun sage: Es ist gleich wahrscheinlich, dass ich ei- ne weisse Kugel wie eine schwarze ziehen werde, so heisst das: Alle mir bekannten Umstände (die hypothetisch angenommenen Naturgesetze mitinbegrien) geben dem Eintreen des einen Er-
128
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
eignisses nicht m e h r Wahrscheinlichkeit als dem Eintreen des anderen. Das heisst, sie gebenwie aus den obigen Erklärungen leicht zu entnehmen istjedem die Wahrscheinlichkeit 1
2 .
Was ich durch den Versuch bestätige ist, dass das Eintreen der beiden Ereignisse von den Umständen, die ich nicht näher kenne, unabhängig ist.
5.155 Die Einheit des Wahrscheinlichkeitssatzes ist: Die Umstände die ich sonst nicht weiter kennegeben dem Eintreen eines bestimmten Ereignisses den und den Grad der Wahrscheinlich- keit.
5.156 So ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit eine Verallgemeinerung.
Sie involviert eine allgemeine Beschreibung einer Satzform.
Nur in Ermanglung der Gewissheit gebrauchen wir die Wahr- scheinlichkeit.Wenn wir zwar eine Tatsache nicht vollkommen kennen, wohl aber e t w a s über ihre Form wissen.
(Ein Satz kann zwar ein unvollständiges Bild einer gewissen Sachlage sein, aber er ist immer e i n vollständiges Bild.)
Der Wahrscheinlichkeitssatz ist gleichsam ein Auszug aus an- deren Sätzen.
5.2 Die Strukturen der Sätze stehen in internen Beziehungen zu ein- ander.
5.21 Wir können diese internen Beziehungen dadurch in unserer Aus- drucksweise hervorheben, dass wir einen Satz als Resultat einer Operation darstellen, die ihn aus anderen Sätzen (den Basen der Operation) hervorbringt.
5.22 Die Operation ist der Ausdruck einer Beziehung zwischen den Strukturen ihres Resultats und ihrer Basen.
5.23 Die Operation ist das, was mit dem einen Satz geschehen muss, um aus ihm den anderen zu machen.
5.231 Und das wird natürlich von ihren formalen Eigenschaften, von der internen Ähnlichkeit ihrer Formen abhängen.
5.232 Die interne Relation, die eine Reihe ordnet, ist äquivalent mit der Operation, durch welche ein Glied aus dem anderen entsteht.
5.233 Die Operation kann erst dort auftreten, wo ein Satz auf logisch bedeutungsvolle Weise aus einem anderen entsteht. Also dort,
129
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
wo die logische Konstruktion des Satzes anfängt.
5.234 Die Wahrheitsfunktionen der Elementarsätze sind Resultate von Operationen, die die Elementarsätze als Basen haben. (Ich nenne diese Operationen Wahrheitsoperationen.)
5.2341 Der Sinn einer Wahrheitsfunktion von p ist eine Funktion des
Sinnes von p.
Verneinung, logische Addition, logische Multiplikation, etc., etc. sind Operationen.
(Die Verneinung verkehrt den Sinn des Satzes.)
5.24 Die Operation zeigt sich in einer Variablen; sie zeigt, wie man von einer Form von Sätzen zu einer anderen gelangen kann.
Sie bringt den Unterschied der Formen zum Ausdruck.
(Und das Gemeinsame zwischen den Basen und dem Resultat der Operation sind eben die Basen.)
5.241 Die Operation kennzeichnet keine Form, sondern nur den Un- terschied der Formen.
5.242 Dieselbe Operation, die q aus p macht, macht aus q r
u. s. f. Dies kann nur darin ausgedrückt sein, dass p, q, r, etc. Variable sind, die gewisse formale Relationen allgemein zum Ausdruck bringen.
5.25 Das Vorkommen der Operation charakterisiert den Sinn des Sat- zes nicht.
Die Operation sagt ja nichts aus, nur ihr Resultat, und dies hängt von den Basen der Operation ab.
(Operation und Funktion dürfen nicht miteinander verwech- selt werden.)
5.251 Eine Funktion kann nicht ihr eigenes Argument sein, wohl aber kann das Resultat einer Operation ihre eigene Basis werden.
5.252 Nur so ist das Fortschreiten von Glied zu Glied in einer Formen- reihe (von Type zu Type in den Hierarchien Russells und White- heads) möglich. (Russell und Whitehead haben die Möglichkeit dieses Fortschreitens nicht zugegeben, aber immer wieder von ihr Gebrauch gemacht.)
5.2521 Die fortgesetzte Anwendung einer Operation auf ihr eigenes Re- sultat nenne ich ihre successive Anwendung (O′O′O′a ist das
130
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Resultat der dreimaligen successiven Anwendung von O′ξ auf
a).
In einem ähnlichen Sinne rede ich von der successiven An- wendung m e h r e r e r Operationen auf eine Anzahl von Sätzen.
5.2522 Das allgemeine Glied einer Formenreihe a, O′a, O′O′a, ....
schreibe ich daher so: [a,x,O′x]. Dieser Klammerausdruck ist eine Variable. Das erste Glied des Klammerausdruckes ist der Anfang der Formenreihe, das zweite die Form eines beliebigen Gliedes x der Reihe und das dritte die Form desjenigen Gliedes der Reihe, welches auf x unmittelbar folgt.
5.2523 Der Begri der successiven Anwendung der Operation ist äqui- valent mit dem Begri und so weiter.
5.253 Eine Operation kann die Wirkung einer anderen rückgängig ma- chen. Operationen können einander aufheben.
5.254 Die Operation kann verschwinden (z. B. die Verneinung in
∼∼p, ∼∼p= p).
5.3 Alle Sätze sind Resultate von Wahrheitsoperationen mit den Elementarsätzen.
Die Wahrheitsoperation ist die Art und Weise, wie aus den Elementarsätzen die Wahrheitsfunktion entsteht.
Nach dem Wesen der Wahrheitsoperation wird auf die glei- che Weise, wie aus den Elementarsätzen ihre Wahrheitsfunktion, aus Wahrheitsfunktionen eine Neue. Jede Wahrheitsoperation erzeugt aus Wahrheitsfunktionen von Elementarsätzen wieder eine Wahrheitsfunktion von Elementarsätzen, einen Satz. Das Resultat jeder Wahrheitsoperation mit den Resultaten von Wahrheitsoperationen mit Elementarsätzen ist wieder das Resultat E i n e r Wahrheitsoperation mit Elementarsätzen.
Jeder Satz ist das Resultat von Wahrheitsoperationen mit Elementarsätzen.
5.31 Die Schemata No. 4.31 haben auch dann eine Bedeutung, wenn
p, q, r, etc. nicht Elementarsätze sind.
Und es ist leicht zu sehen, dass das Satzzeichen in No. 4.442,
auch wenn p und q Wahrheitsfunktionen von Elemen- tarsätzen sind, Eine Wahrheitsfunktion von Elementarsätzen ausdrückt.
131
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
5.32 Alle Wahrheitsfunktionen sind Resultate der successiven An- wendung einer endlichen Anzahl von Wahrheitsoperationen auf die Elementarsätze.
5.4 Hier zeigt es sich, dass es logische Gegenstände, logische Konstante (im Sinne Freges und Russells) nicht gibt.
5.41 Denn: Alle Resultate von Wahrheitsoperationen mit Wahrheits- funktionen sind identisch, welche eine und dieselbe Wahrheits- funktion von Elementarsätzen sind.
5.42 Dass ∨, ⊃, etc. nicht Beziehungen im Sinne von rechts und links etc. sind, leuchtet ein.
Die Möglichkeit des kreuzweisen Denierens der logischen Urzeichen Freges und Russells zeigt schon, dass dies keine Urzeichen sind, und schon erst recht, dass sie keine Relationen bezeichnen.
Und es ist oenbar, dass das ⊃, welches wir durch ∼
und ∨ denieren, identisch ist mit dem, durch welches wir
∨ mit ∼ denieren und dass dieses ∨ mit dem ersten
identisch ist. U. s. w.
5.43 Dass aus einer Tatsache p unendlich viele a n d e r e folgen soll-
ten, nämlich ∼∼p, ∼∼∼∼p, etc., ist doch von vornherein kaum zu glauben. Und nicht weniger merkwürdig ist, dass die unend- liche Anzahl der Sätze der Logik (der Mathematik) aus einem halben Dutzend Grundgesetzen folgen.
Alle Sätze der Logik sagen aber dasselbe. Nämlich Nichts.
5.44 Die Wahrheitsfunktionen sind keine materiellen Funktionen.
Wenn man z. B. eine Bejahung durch doppelte Verneinung erzeugen kann, ist dann die Verneinungin irgend einem Sinn in der Bejahung enthalten? Verneint ∼∼p∼p, oder bejaht
es p; oder beides?
Der Satz ∼∼p handelt nicht von der Verneinung wie von einem Gegenstand; wohl aber ist die Möglichkeit der Vernei- nung in der Bejahung bereits präjudiziert.
Und gäbe es einen Gegenstand, der ∼ hiesse, so müsste
∼∼p etwas anderes sagen als p. Denn der eine Satz würde
dann eben von ∼ handeln, der andere nicht.
5.441 Dieses Verschwinden der scheinbaren logischen Konstanten tritt
132
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
auch ein, wenn ∼(∃x).
∼fx dasselbe sagt wie (x) .fx, oder
(∃x) .fx.x= a dasselbe wie fa.
5.442 Wenn uns ein Satz gegeben ist, so sind m i t i h m auch schon die Resultate aller Wahrheitsoperationen, die ihn zur Basis ha- ben, gegeben.
5.45 Gibt es logische Urzeichen, so muss eine richtige Logik ihre Stellung zueinander klar machen und ihr Dasein rechtfertigen. Der Bau der Logik a u s ihren Urzeichen muss klar werden.
5.451 Hat die Logik Grundbegrie, so müssen sie von einander un- abhängig sein. Ist ein Grundbegri eingeführt, so muss er in allen Verbindungen eingeführt sein, worin er überhaupt vor- kommt. Man kann ihn also nicht zuerst für e i n e Verbindung, dann noch einmal für eine andere einführen. Z. B.: Ist die Ver- neinung eingeführt, so müssen wir sie jetzt in Sätzen von der Form ∼p ebenso verstehen, wie in Sätzen wie ∼(p∨q),
(∃x).
∼fx u. a. Wir dürfen sie nicht erst für die eine Klas- se von Fällen, dann für die andere einführen, denn es bliebe dann zweifelhaft, ob ihre Bedeutung in beiden Fällen die glei- che wäre und es wäre kein Grund vorhanden, in beiden Fällen dieselbe Art der Zeichenverbindung zu benützen.
(Kurz, für die Einführung der Urzeichen gilt, mutatis mu- tandis, dasselbe, was Frege (Grundgesetze der Arithmetik) für die Einführung von Zeichen durch Denitionen gesagt hat.)
5.452 Die Einführung eines neuen Behelfes in den Symbolismus der Logik muss immer ein folgenschweres Ereignis sein. Kein neu- er Behelf darf in die Logiksozusagen, mit ganz unschuldiger Mienein Klammern oder unter dem Striche eingeführt wer- den.
(So kommen in den Principia Mathematica von Russell und Whitehead Denitionen und Grundgesetze in Worten vor. Warum hier plötzlich Worte? Dies bedürfte einer Rechtferti- gung. Sie fehlt und muss fehlen, da das Vorgehen tatsächlich unerlaubt ist.)
Hat sich aber die Einführung eines neuen Behelfes an einer Stelle als nötig erwiesen, so muss man sich nun sofort fragen: Wo muss dieser Behelf nun i m m e r angewandt werden? Seine Stellung in der Logik muss nun erklärt werden.
133
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
5.453 Alle Zahlen der Logik müssen sich rechtfertigen lassen.
Oder vielmehr: Es muss sich herausstellen, dass es in der Logik keine Zahlen gibt.
Es gibt keine ausgezeichneten Zahlen.
5.454 In der Logik gibt es kein Nebeneinander, kann es keine Klassi- kation geben.
In der Logik kann es nicht Allgemeineres und Spezielleres geben.
5.4541 Die Lösungen der logischen Probleme müssen einfach sein, denn sie setzen den Standard der Einfachheit.
Die Menschen haben immer geahnt, dass es ein Gebiet von Fragen geben müsse, deren Antwortena priorisymmetrisch, und zu einem abgeschlossenen, regelmässigen Gebilde vereint- liegen.
Ein Gebiet, in dem der Satz gilt: simplex sigillum veri.
5.46 Wenn man die logischen Zeichen richtig einführte, so hätte man damit auch schon den Sinn aller ihrer Kombinationen eingeführt; also nicht nur p∨q sondern auch schon ∼(p∨
∼q) etc. etc. Man hätte damit auch schon die Wirkung aller nur möglichen Kombinationen von Klammern eingeführt. Und damit wäre es klar geworden, dass die eigentlichen allgemeinen Urzeichen nicht die p∨q, (∃x) .fx, etc. sind, sondern die allgemeinste Form ihrer Kombinationen.
5.461 Bedeutungsvoll ist die scheinbar unwichtige Tatsache, dass die logischen Scheinbeziehungen, wie ∨und ⊃, der Klammern be- dürfenim Gegensatz zu den wirklichen Beziehungen.
Die Benützung der Klammern mit jenen scheinbaren Urzei- chen deutet ja schon darauf hin, dass diese nicht die wirklichen Urzeichen sind. Und es wird doch wohl niemand glauben, dass die Klammern eine selbständige Bedeutung haben.
5.4611 Die logischen Operationszeichen sind Interpunktionen.
5.47 Es ist klar, dass alles was sich überhaupt v o n v o r n h e r e i n über die Form aller Sätze sagen lässt, sich a u f e i n m a l sagen lassen muss.
Sind ja schon im Elementarsatze alle logischen Operationen enthalten. Denn fa sagt dasselbe wie (∃x) .fx.x= a.
134
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Wo Zusammengesetztheit ist, da ist Argument und Funkti- on, und wo diese sind, sind bereits alle logischen Konstanten.
Man könnte sagen: Die Eine logische Konstante ist das, was a l l e Sätze, ihrer Natur nach, mit einander gemein haben.
Das aber ist die allgemeine Satzform.
5.471 Die allgemeine Satzform ist das Wesen des Satzes.
5.4711 Das Wesen des Satzes angeben, heisst, das Wesen aller Be- schreibung angeben, also das Wesen der Welt.
5.472 Die Beschreibung der allgemeinsten Satzform ist die Beschrei- bung des einen und einzigen allgemeinen Urzeichens der Logik.
5.473 Die Logik muss für sich selber sorgen.
Ein m ö g l i c h e s Zeichen muss auch bezeichnen können. Al- les was in der Logik möglich ist, ist auch erlaubt. (Sokrates ist identisch heisst darum nichts, weil es keine Eigenschaft gibt, die identisch heisst. Der Satz ist unsinnig, weil wir eine will- kürliche Bestimmung nicht getroen haben, aber nicht darum, weil das Symbol an und für sich unerlaubt wäre.)
Wir können uns, in gewissem Sinne, nicht in der Logik irren.
5.4731 Das Einleuchten, von dem Russell so viel sprach, kann nur da- durch in der Logik entbehrlich werden, dass die Sprache selbst jeden logischen Fehler verhindert.Dass die Logik a priori ist, besteht darin, dass nicht unlogisch gedacht werden ka n n.
5.4732 Wir können einem Zeichen nicht den unrechten Sinn geben.
5.47321 Occams Devise ist natürlich keine willkürliche, oder durch ih- ren praktischen Erfolg gerechtfertigte, Regel: Sie besagt, dass u n n ö t i g e Zeicheneinheiten nichts bedeuten.
Zeichen, die E i n e n Zweck erfüllen, sind logisch äquivalent, Zeichen, die k e i n e n Zweck erfüllen, logisch bedeutungslos.
5.4733 Frege sagt: Jeder rechtmässig gebildete Satz muss einen Sinn haben; und ich sage: Jeder mögliche Satz ist rechtmässig ge- bildet, und wenn er keinen Sinn hat, so kann das nur daran liegen, dass wir einigen seiner Bestandteile keine B e d e u t u n g gegeben haben.
(Wenn wir auch glauben, es getan zu haben.)
135
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
So sagt Sokrates ist identisch darum nichts, weil wir dem Wort identisch als E i g e n s c h a f t s w o r t k e i n e Bedeutung gegeben haben. Denn, wenn es als Gleichheitszeichen auftritt, so symbolisiert es auf ganz andere Art und Weisedie bezeich- nende Beziehung ist eine andere,also ist auch das Symbol in beiden Fällen ganz verschieden; die beiden Symbole haben nur das Zeichen zufällig miteinander gemein.
5.474 Die Anzahl der nötigen Grundoperationen hängt n u r von un- serer Notation ab.
5.475 Es kommt nur darauf an, ein Zeichensystem von einer be- stimmten Anzahl von Dimensionenvon einer bestimmten ma- thematischen Mannigfaltigkeitzu bilden.
5.476 Es ist klar, dass es sich hier nicht um eine A n z a h l v o n G r u n d b e g r i f f e n handelt, die bezeichnet werden müssen, sondern um den Ausdruck einer Regel.
5.5 Jede Wahrheitsfunktion ist ein Resultat der successiven An- wendung der Operation ( W)(ξ,....) auf Elementarsät-
ze.
Diese Operation verneint sämtliche Sätze in der rechten Klammer und ich nenne sie die Negation dieser Sätze.
5.501 Einen Klammerausdruck, dessen Glieder Sätze sind, deute ich wenn die Reihenfolge der Glieder in der Klammer gleich- gültig istdurch ein Zeichen von der Form (ξ) an. ξ ist eine Variable, deren Werte die Glieder des Klammerausdruckes sind; und der Strich über der Variablen deutet an, dass sie ihre sämtlichen Werte in der Klammer vertritt.
(Hat also ξ etwa die 3 Werte P, Q, R, so ist (ξ) = (P, Q,
R).)
Die Werte der Variablen werden festgesetzt.
Die Festsetzung ist die Beschreibung der Sätze, welche die Variable vertritt.
Wie die Beschreibung der Glieder des Klammerausdruckes geschieht, ist unwesentlich.
Wir k ö n n e n drei Arten der Beschreibung unterscheiden: 1. Die direkte Aufzählung. In diesem Fall können wir statt der Variablen einfach ihre konstanten Werte setzen. 2. Die Angabe
136
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
einer Funktion fx, deren Werte für alle Werte von x die zu beschreibenden Sätze sind. 3. Die Angabe eines formalen Ge- setzes, nach welchem jene Sätze gebildet sind. In diesem Falle sind die Glieder des Klammerausdrucks sämtliche Glieder einer Formenreihe.
5.502 Ich schreibe also statt ( W)(ξ,....) N(ξ).
N(ξ) ist die Negation sämtlicher Werte der Satzvariablen
ξ.
5.503 Da sich oenbar leicht ausdrücken lässt, wie mit dieser Opera- tion Sätze gebildet werden können und wie Sätze mit ihr nicht zu bilden sind, so muss dies auch einen exakten Ausdruck n- den können.
5.51 Hat ξ nur einen Wert, so ist N(ξ) =∼p (nicht p), hat es zwei
Werte, so ist N(ξ) =∼p.∼q (weder p noch q).
5.511 Wie kann die allumfassende, weltspiegelnde Logik so spezielle Haken und Manipulationen gebrauchen? Nur, indem sich al- le diese zu einem unendlich feinen Netzwerk, zu dem grossen Spiegel, verknüpfen.
5.512 ∼p ist wahr, wenn p falsch ist. Also in dem wahren Satz
∼p ist p ein falscher Satz. Wie kann ihn nun der Strich
∼ mit der Wirklichkeit zum Stimmen bringen?
Das, was in ∼p verneint, ist aber nicht das ∼, sondern dasjenige, was allen Zeichen dieser Notation, welche p vernei-
nen, gemeinsam ist.
Also die gemeinsame Regel, nach welcher ∼p, ∼∼∼p,
∼p∨∼p, ∼p.∼p, etc. etc. (ad inf.) gebildet werden. Und dies Gemeinsame spiegelt die Verneinung wider.
5.513 Man könnte sagen: Das Gemeinsame aller Symbole, die sowohl
p als q bejahen, ist der Satz p.q. Das Gemeinsame aller
Symbole, die entweder p oder q bejahen, ist der Satz p∨q.
Und so kann man sagen: Zwei Sätze sind einander entge- gengesetzt, wenn sie nichts miteinander gemein haben, und: Jeder Satz hat nur ein Negativ, weil es nur einen Satz gibt, der ganz ausserhalb seiner liegt.
Es zeigt sich so auch in Russells Notation, dass q: p∨∼p
dasselbe sagt wie q; dass p∨∼p nichts sagt.
137
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
5.514 Ist eine Notation festgelegt, so gibt es in ihr eine Regel, nach der alle p verneinenden Sätze gebildet werden, eine Regel, nach
der alle p bejahenden Sätze gebildet werden, eine Regel, nach
der alle p oder q bejahenden Sätze gebildet werden, u. s. f. Die- se Regeln sind den Symbolen äquivalent und in ihnen spiegelt sich ihr Sinn wider.
5.515 Es muss sich an unseren Symbolen zeigen, dass das, was durch
∨, ., etc. miteinander verbunden ist, Sätze sein müssen.
Und dies ist auch der Fall, denn das Symbol p und q
setzt ja selbst das ∨, ∼, etc. voraus. Wenn das Zeichen p
in p∨q nicht für ein komplexes Zeichen steht, dann kann es allein nicht Sinn haben; dann können aber auch die mit p
gleichsinnigen Zeichen p∨p, p.p, etc. keinen Sinn haben.
Wenn aber p∨p keinen Sinn hat, dann kann auch p∨q
keinen Sinn haben.
5.5151 Muss das Zeichen des negativen Satzes mit dem Zeichen des positiven gebildet werden? Warum sollte man den negativen Satz nicht durch eine negative Tatsache ausdrücken können. (Etwa: Wenn a nicht in einer bestimmten Beziehung zu b
steht, könnte das ausdrücken, dass aRb nicht der Fall ist.)
Aber auch hier ist ja der negative Satz indirekt durch den positiven gebildet.
Der positive S a t z muss die Existenz des negativen S a t z e s voraussetzen und umgekehrt.
5.52 Sind die Werte von ξ sämtliche Werte einer Funktion fx für
alle Werte von x, so wird N(ξ) =∼(∃x) .fx.
5.521 Ich trenne den Begri A l l e von der Wahrheitsfunktion.
Frege und Russell haben die Allgemeinheit in Verbindung mit dem logischen Produkt oder der logischen Summe einge- führt. So wurde es schwer, die Sätze (∃x) .fx und (x) .fx,
in welchen beide Ideen beschlossen liegen, zu verstehen.
5.522 Das Eigentümliche der Allgemeinheitsbezeichnung ist erstens, dass sie auf ein logisches Urbild hinweist, und zweitens, dass sie Konstante hervorhebt.
5.523 Die Allgemeinheitsbezeichnung tritt als Argument auf.
138
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
5.524 Wenn die Gegenstände gegeben sind, so sind uns damit auch schon a l l e Gegenstände gegeben.
Wenn die Elementarsätze gegeben sind, so sind damit auch a l l e Elementarsätze gegeben.
5.525 Es ist unrichtig, den Satz (∃x) .fxwie Russell dies tutin
Worten durch fx ist m ö g l i c h wiederzugeben.
Gewissheit, Möglichkeit oder Unmöglichkeit einer Sachlage wird nicht durch einen Satz ausgedrückt, sondern dadurch, dass ein Ausdruck eine Tautologie, ein sinnvoller Satz, oder eine Kontradiktion ist.
Jener Präzedenzfall, auf den man sich immer berufen möch- te, muss schon im Symbol selber liegen.
5.526 Man kann die Welt vollständig durch vollkommen verallgemei- nerte Sätze beschreiben, das heisst also, ohne irgend einen Na- men von vornherein einem bestimmten Gegenstand zuzuord- nen.
Um dann auf die gewöhnliche Ausdrucksweise zu kommen, muss man einfach nach einem Ausdruck es gibt ein und nur ein x, welches .... sagen: Und dies x ist a.
5.5261 Ein vollkommen verallgemeinerter Satz ist, wie jeder ande- re Satz zusammengesetzt. (Dies zeigt sich daran, dass wir in
(∃x,ϕ).ϕx ϕ und x getrennt erwähnen müssen. Beide ste- hen unabhängig in bezeichnenden Beziehungen zur Welt, wie im unverallgemeinerten Satz.)
Kennzeichen des zusammengesetzten Symbols: Es hat etwas mit a n d e r e n Symbolen gemeinsam.
5.5262 Es verändert ja die Wahr- oder Falschheit j e d e s Satzes etwas am allgemeinen Bau der Welt. Und der Spielraum, welcher ihrem Bau durch die Gesamtheit der Elementarsätze gelassen wird, ist eben derjenige, welchen die ganz allgemeinen Sätze begrenzen.
(Wenn ein Elementarsatz wahr ist, so ist damit doch jeden- falls Ein Elementarsatz m e h r wahr.)
5.53 Gleichheit des Gegenstandes drücke ich durch Gleichheit des Zeichens aus, und nicht mit Hilfe eines Gleichheitszeichens. Verschiedenheit der Gegenstände durch Verschiedenheit der Zeichen.
139
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
5.5301 Dass die Identität keine Relation zwischen Gegenständen ist, leuchtet ein. Dies wird sehr klar, wenn man z. B. den Satz
(x) : fx. ⊃ .x = a betrachtet. Was dieser Satz sagt, ist
einfach, dass n u r a der Funktion f genügt, und nicht, dass
nur solche Dinge der Funktion f genügen, welche eine gewisse
Beziehung zu a haben.
Man könnte nun freilich sagen, dass eben n u r a diese
Beziehung zu a habe, aber um dies auszudrücken, brauchten wir das Gleichheitszeichen selber.
5.5302 Russells Denition von = genügt nicht; weil man nach ihr nicht sagen kann, dass zwei Gegenstände alle Eigenschaften gemeinsam haben. (Selbst wenn dieser Satz nie richtig ist, hat er doch S i n n.)
5.5303 Beiläug gesprochen: Von z w e i Dingen zu sagen, sie seien identisch, ist ein Unsinn, und von E i n e m zu sagen, es sei identisch mit sich selbst, sagt gar nichts.
5.531 Ich schreibe also nicht f(a,b) .a= b, sondern f(a,a) (oder
f(b,b)). Und nicht f(a,b).
∼a= b, sondern f(a,b).
5.532 Und analog: Nicht (∃x,y) .f(x,y) .x = y, sondern (∃x).
f(x,x); und nicht (∃x,y) .f(x,y).
∼x= y, sondern (∃x,y).
f(x,y).
(Also statt des Russell'schen (∃x,y) . f(x,y): (∃x,y).
f(x,y).∨.(∃x) .f(x,x).)
5.5321 Statt (x) : fx⊃x= a schreiben wir also z. B. (∃x) .fx.⊃
.fa: ∼(∃x,y) .fx.fy.
Und der Satz n u r Ein x befriedigt f() lautet: (∃x) .fx:
∼(∃x,y) .fx.fy.
5.533 Das Gleichheitszeichen ist also kein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Begrisschrift.
5.534 Und nun sehen wir, dass Scheinsätze wie: a= a, a= b.b=
c. ⊃a = c, (x) .x = x, (∃x) .x = a, etc. sich in einer richtigen Begrisschrift gar nicht hinschreiben lassen.
5.535 Damit erledigen sich auch alle Probleme, die an solche Schein- sätze geknüpft waren.
Alle Probleme, die Russells Axiom of Innity mit sich bringt, sind schon hier zu lösen.

LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Das, was das Axiom of innity sagen soll, würde sich in der Sprache dadurch ausdrücken, dass es unendlich viele Namen mit verschiedener Bedeutung gäbe.
5.5351 Es gibt gewisse Fälle, wo man in Versuchung gerät, Ausdrücke von der Form a = a oder p ⊃ p u. dgl. zu benützen. Und zwar geschieht dies, wenn man von dem Urbild: Satz, Ding, etc. reden möchte. So hat Russell in den Principles of Mathematics den Unsinn p ist ein Satz in Symbolen durch
p ⊃p wiedergegeben und als Hypothese vor gewisse Sätze gestellt, damit deren Argumentstellen nur von Sätzen besetzt werden könnten.
(Es ist schon darum Unsinn, die Hypothese p⊃p vor einen Satz zu stellen, um ihm Argumente der richtigen Form zu si- chern, weil die Hypothese für einen Nicht-Satz als Argument nicht falsch, sondern unsinnig wird, und weil der Satz selbst durch die unrichtige Gattung von Argumenten unsinnig wird, also sich selbst ebenso gut, oder so schlecht, vor den unrech- ten Argumenten bewahrt, wie die zu diesem Zweck angehängte sinnlose Hypothese.)
5.5352 Ebenso wollte man Es gibt keine D i n g e ausdrücken durch
∼(∃x) .x= x. Aber selbst wenn dies ein Satz wäre,wäre er nicht auch wahr, wenn es zwar Dinge gäbe, aber diese nicht mit sich selbst identisch wären?
5.54 In der allgemeinen Satzform kommt der Satz im Satze nur als Basis der Wahrheitsoperationen vor.
5.541 Auf den ersten Blick scheint es, als könne ein Satz in einem anderen auch auf andere Weise vorkommen.
Besonders in gewissen Satzformen der Psychologie, wie A glaubt, dass p der Fall ist, oder A denkt p, etc.
Hier scheint es nämlich oberächlich, als stünde der Satz p
zu einem Gegenstand A in einer Art von Relation.
(Und in der modernen Erkenntnistheorie (Russell, Moore, etc.) sind jene Sätze auch so aufgefasst worden.)
5.542 Es ist aber klar, dass A glaubt, dass p, A denkt p, A
sagt p von der Form p` sagt p sind: Und hier handelt es sich nicht um eine Zuordnung von einer Tatsache und einem
141
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Gegenstand, sondern um die Zuordnung von Tatsachen durch Zuordnung ihrer Gegenstände.
5.5421 Dies zeigt auch, dass die Seeledas Subjekt, etc.wie sie in der heutigen oberächlichen Psychologie aufgefasst wird, ein Unding ist.
Eine zusammengesetzte Seele wäre nämlich keine Seele mehr.
5.5422 Die richtige Erklärung der Form des Satzes A urteilt p muss zeigen, dass es unmöglich ist, einen Unsinn zu urteilen. (Rus- sells Theorie genügt dieser Bedingung nicht.)
5.5423 Einen Komplex wahrnehmen, heisst, wahrnehmen, dass sich seine Bestandteile so und so zu einander verhalten.
Dies erklärt wohl auch, dass man die Figur
auf zweierlei Art als Würfel sehen kann; und alle ähnlichen Erscheinungen. Denn wir sehen eben wirklich zwei verschiedene Tatsachen.
(Sehe ich erst auf die Ecken a und nur üchtig auf b, so
erscheint a vorne; und umgekehrt.)
5.55 Wir müssen nun die Frage nach allen möglichen Formen der Elementarsätze a priori beantworten.
Der Elementarsatz besteht aus Namen. Da wir aber die Anzahl der Namen von verschiedener Bedeutung nicht angeben können, so können wir auch nicht die Zusammensetzung des Elementarsatzes angeben.
5.551 Unser Grundsatz ist, dass jede Frage, die sich überhaupt durch die Logik entscheiden lässt, sich ohne weiteres entscheiden las- sen muss.
142
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
(Und wenn wir in die Lage kommen, ein solches Problem durch Ansehen der Welt beantworten zu müssen, so zeigt dies, dass wir auf grundfalscher Fährte sind.)
5.552 Die Erfahrung, die wir zum Verstehen der Logik brauchen, ist nicht die, dass sich etwas so und so verhält, sondern, dass etwas i s t: aber das ist eben k e i n e Erfahrung.
Die Logik ist v o r jeder Erfahrungdass etwas s o ist.
Sie ist vor dem Wie, nicht vor dem Was.
5.5521 Und wenn dies nicht so wäre, wie könnten wir die Logik anwen- den? Man könnte sagen: Wenn es eine Logik gäbe, auch wenn es keine Welt gäbe, wie könnte es dann eine Logik geben, da es eine Welt gibt.
5.553 Russell sagte, es gäbe einfache Relationen zwischen verschie- denen Anzahlen von Dingen (Individuals). Aber zwischen wel- chen Anzahlen? Und wie soll sich das entscheiden?Durch die Erfahrung?
(Eine ausgezeichnete Zahl gibt es nicht.)
5.554 Die Angabe jeder speziellen Form wäre vollkommen willkürlich.
5.5541 Es soll sich a priori angeben lassen, ob ich z. B. in die Lage kommen kann, etwas mit dem Zeichen einer 27-stelligen Rela- tion bezeichnen zu müssen.
5.5542 Dürfen wir denn aber überhaupt so fragen? Können wir eine Zeichenform aufstellen und nicht wissen, ob ihr etwas entspre- chen könne?
Hat die Frage einen Sinn: Was muss s e i n, damit etwas der-Fall-sein kann?
5.555 Es ist klar, wir haben vom Elementarsatz einen Begri, abge- sehen von seiner besonderen logischen Form.
Wo man aber Symbole nach einem System bilden kann, dort ist dieses System das logisch wichtige und nicht die ein- zelnen Symbole.
Und wie wäre es auch möglich, dass ich es in der Logik mit Formen zu tun hätte, die ich ernden kann; sondern mit dem muss ich es zu tun haben, was es mir möglich macht, sie zu ernden.
143
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
5.556 Eine Hierarchie der Formen der Elementarsätze kann es nicht geben. Nur was wir selbst konstruieren, können wir vorausse- hen.
5.5561 Die empirische Realität ist begrenzt durch die Gesamtheit der Gegenstände. Die Grenze zeigt sich wieder in der Gesamtheit der Elementarsätze.
Die Hierarchien sind, und müssen unabhängig von der Rea- lität sein.
5.5562 Wissen wir aus rein logischen Gründen, dass es Elementarsätze geben muss, dann muss es jeder wissen, der die Sätze in ihrer unanalysierten Form versteht.
5.5563 Alle Sätze unserer Umgangssprache sind tatsächlich, so wie sie sind, logisch vollkommen geordnet.Jenes Einfachste, was wir hier angeben sollen, ist nicht ein Gleichnis der Wahrheit, sondern die volle Wahrheit selbst.
(Unsere Probleme sind nicht abstrakt, sondern vielleicht die konkretesten, die es gibt.)
5.557 Die A n w e n d u n g der Logik entscheidet darüber, welche Ele- mentarsätze es gibt.
Was in der Anwendung liegt, kann die Logik nicht voraus- nehmen.
Das ist klar: Die Logik darf mit ihrer Anwendung nicht kollidieren.
Aber die Logik muss sich mit ihrer Anwendung berühren.
Also dürfen die Logik und ihre Anwendung einander nicht übergreifen.
5.5571 Wenn ich die Elementarsätze nicht a priori angeben kann, dann muss es zu oenbarem Unsinn führen, sie angeben zu wollen.
5.6 D i e G r e n z e n m e i n e r S p r a c h e bedeuten die Grenzen meiner Welt.
5.61 Die Logik erfüllt die Welt; die Grenzen der Welt sind auch ihre Grenzen.
Wir können also in der Logik nicht sagen: Das und das gibt es in der Welt, jenes nicht.
Das würde nämlich scheinbar voraussetzen, dass wir gewisse Möglichkeiten ausschliessen und dies kann nicht der Fall sein,
144
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
da sonst die Logik über die Grenzen der Welt hinaus müsste; wenn sie nämlich diese Grenzen auch von der anderen Seite betrachten könnte.
Was wir nicht denken können, das können wir nicht den- ken; wir können also auch nicht s a g e n, was wir nicht denken können.
5.62 Diese Bemerkung gibt den Schlüssel zur Entscheidung der Fra- ge, inwieweit der Solipsismus eine Wahrheit ist.
Was der Solipsismus nämlich m e i n t, ist ganz richtig, nur lässt es sich nicht s a g e n, sondern es zeigt sich.
Dass die Welt m e i n e Welt ist, das zeigt sich darin, dass die Grenzen d e r Sprache (der Sprache, die allein ich verstehe) die Grenzen m e i n e r Welt bedeuten.
5.621 Die Welt und das Leben sind Eins.
5.63 Ich bin meine Welt. (Der Mikrokosmos.)
5.631 Das denkende, vorstellende, Subjekt gibt es nicht.
Wenn ich ein Buch schriebe Die Welt, wie ich sie vor- fand, so wäre darin auch über meinen Leib zu berichten und zu sagen, welche Glieder meinem Willen unterstehen und wel- che nicht etc., dies ist nämlich eine Methode, das Subjekt zu isolieren, oder vielmehr zu zeigen, dass es in einem wichtigen Sinne kein Subjekt gibt: Von ihm allein nämlich könnte in die- sem Buche n i c h t die Rede sein.
5.632 Das Subjekt gehört nicht zur Welt, sondern es ist eine Grenze der Welt.
5.633 Wo in der Welt ist ein metaphysisches Subjekt zu merken?
Du sagst, es verhält sich hier ganz, wie mit Auge und Ge- sichtsfeld. Aber das Auge siehst du wirklich n i c h t.
Und nichts a m G e s i c h t s f e l d lässt darauf schliessen, dass es von einem Auge gesehen wird.
5.6331 Das Gesichtsfeld hat nämlich nicht etwa eine solche Form:
145
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
5.634 Das hängt damit zusammen, dass kein Teil unserer Erfahrung auch a priori ist.
Alles, was wir sehen, könnte auch anders sein.
Alles, was wir überhaupt beschreiben können, könnte auch anders sein.
Es gibt keine Ordnung der Dinge a priori.
5.64 Hier sieht man, dass der Solipsismus, streng durchgeführt, mit dem reinen Realismus zusammenfällt. Das Ich des Solipsis- mus schrumpft zum ausdehnungslosen Punkt zusammen, und es bleibt die ihm koordinierte Realität.
5.641 Es gibt also wirklich einen Sinn, in welchem in der Philosophie nicht-psychologisch vom Ich die Rede sein kann.
Das Ich tritt in die Philosophie dadurch ein, dass die Welt meine Welt ist.
Das philosophische Ich ist nicht der Mensch, nicht der menschliche Körper, oder die menschliche Seele, von der die Psychologie handelt, sondern das metaphysische Subjekt, die Grenzenicht ein Teil der Welt.
6 Die allgemeine Form der Wahrheitsfunktion ist: [p,ξ,N(ξ)].
Dies ist die allgemeine Form des Satzes.
6.001 Dies sagt nichts anderes, als dass jeder Satz ein Resultat der successiven Anwendung der Operation N′(ξ) auf die Elemen-
tarsätze ist.
6.002 Ist die allgemeine Form gegeben, wie ein Satz gebaut ist, so ist damit auch schon die allgemeine Form davon gegeben, wie aus einem Satz durch eine Operation ein anderer erzeugt werden kann.
6.01 Die allgemeine Form der Operation Ω′(η) ist also: [ξ,N(ξ)]′(η)
(= [η, ξ, N(ξ)]).
Das ist die allgemeinste Form des Überganges von einem Satz zum anderen.
6.02 Und so kommen wir zu den Zahlen: Ich deniere
x= Ω0′x Def. und
Ω′Ων′x= Ων+1′x Def.
146
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Nach diesen Zeichenregeln schreiben wir also die Reihe x,
Ω′x, Ω′Ω′x, Ω′Ω′Ω′x, .....
so: Ω0′x,Ω0+1′x,Ω0+1+1′x,Ω0+1+1+1′x,.....
Also schreibe ich statt [x,ξ,Ω′ξ]:
[Ω0′x,Ων′x,Ων+1′x].
Und deniere:
0 + 1 = 1 Def.
0 + 1 + 1 = 2 Def.
0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 Def.
(u. s. f.)
6.021 Die Zahl ist der Exponent einer Operation.
6.022 Der Zahlbegri ist nichts anderes, als das Gemeinsame aller Zahlen, die allgemeine Form der Zahl.
Der Zahlbegri ist die variable Zahl.
Und der Begri der Zahlengleichheit ist die allgemeine Form aller speziellen Zahlengleichheiten.
6.03 Die allgemeine Form der ganzen Zahl ist: [0,ξ,ξ+ 1].
6.031 Die Theorie der Klassen ist in der Mathematik ganz überüs- sig.
Dies hängt damit zusammen, dass die Allgemeinheit, welche wir in der Mathematik brauchen, nicht die z u f ä l l i g e ist.
6.1 Die Sätze der Logik sind Tautologien.
6.11 Die Sätze der Logik sagen also Nichts. (Sie sind die analyti- schen Sätze.)
6.111 Theorien, die einen Satz der Logik gehaltvoll erscheinen lassen, sind immer falsch. Man könnte z. B. glauben, dass die Worte wahr und falsch zwei Eigenschaften unter anderen Eigen- schaften bezeichnen, und da erschiene es als eine merkwürdige Tatsache, dass jeder Satz eine dieser Eigenschaften besitzt. Das scheint nun nichts weniger als selbstverständlich zu sein, eben- sowenig selbstverständlich, wie etwa der Satz, alle Rosen sind
147
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
entweder gelb oder rot klänge, auch wenn er wahr wäre. Ja, jener Satz bekommt nun ganz den Charakter eines naturwis- senschaftlichen Satzes und dies ist das sichere Anzeichen dafür, dass er falsch aufgefasst wurde.
6.112 Die richtige Erklärung der logischen Sätze muss ihnen eine einzigartige Stellung unter allen Sätzen geben.
6.113 Es ist das besondere Merkmal der logischen Sätze, dass man am Symbol allein erkennen kann, dass sie wahr sind, und diese Tatsache schliesst die ganze Philosophie der Logik in sich. Und so ist es auch eine der wichtigsten Tatsachen, dass sich die Wahrheit oder Falschheit der nicht-logischen Sätze n i c h t am Satz allein erkennen lässt.
6.12 Dass die Sätze der Logik Tautologien sind, das z e i g t die for- malenlogischenEigenschaften der Sprache, der Welt.
Dass ihre Bestandteile s o verknüpft eine Tautologie erge- ben, das charakterisiert die Logik ihrer Bestandteile.
Damit Sätze, auf bestimmte Art und Weise verknüpft, eine Tautologie ergeben, dazu müssen sie bestimmte Eigenschaften der Struktur haben. Dass sie s o verbunden eine Tautologie ergeben, zeigt also, dass sie diese Eigenschaften der Struktur besitzen.
6.1201 Dass z. B. die Sätze p und ∼p in der Verbindung ∼(p.∼p)
eine Tautologie ergeben, zeigt, dass sie einander widersprechen. Dass die Sätze p⊃q, p und q in der Form (p⊃q).(p) :⊃:
(q) miteinander verbunden eine Tautologie ergeben, zeigt, dass
q aus p und p⊃q folgt. Dass (x) .fx:⊃: fa eine Tautologie
ist, dass fa aus (x) .fx folgt. etc. etc.
6.1202 Es ist klar, dass man zu demselben Zweck statt der Tautologien auch die Kontradiktionen verwenden könnte.
6.1203 Um eine Tautologie als solche zu erkennen, kann man sich, in den Fällen, in welchen in der Tautologie keine Allgemeinheitsbezeichnung vorkommt, folgender anschaulichen Methode bedienen: Ich schreibe statt p, q, r etc. WpF,
WqF, WrF etc. Die Wahrheitskombinationen drücke ich durch Klammern aus. z. B.:
148
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
und die Zuordnung der Wahr- oder Falschheit des ganzen Sat- zes und der Wahrheitskombinationen der Wahrheitsargumente durch Striche auf folgende Weise:
Dies Zeichen würde also z. B. den Satz p ⊃q darstellen. Nun
will ich z. B. den Satz ∼(p.∼p) (Gesetz des Widerspruchs) daraufhin untersuchen, ob er eine Tautologie ist. Die Form
∼ξ wird in unserer Notation
geschrieben; die Form ξ.η so:
Daher lautet der Satz ∼(p.∼q) so:
149
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Setzen wir hier statt q p ein und untersuchen die Verbin- dung der äussersten W und F mit den innersten, so ergibt sich, dass die Wahrheit des ganzen Satzes a l l e n Wahrheits- kombinationen seines Argumentes, seine Falschheit keiner der Wahrheitskombinationen zugeordnet ist.
6.121 Die Sätze der Logik demonstrieren die logischen Eigenschaften der Sätze, indem sie sie zu nichtssagenden Sätzen verbinden.
Diese Methode könnte man auch eine Nullmethode nennen. Im logischen Satz werden Sätze miteinander ins Gleichgewicht gebracht und der Zustand des Gleichgewichts zeigt dann an, wie diese Sätze logisch beschaen sein müssen.
6.122 Daraus ergibt sich, dass wir auch ohne die logischen Sätze auskommen können, da wir ja in einer entsprechenden Notation die formalen Eigenschaften der Sätze durch das blosse Ansehen dieser Sätze erkennen können.
6.1221 Ergeben z. B. zwei Sätze p und q in der Verbindung p⊃q
eine Tautologie, so ist klar, dass q aus p folgt.
Dass z. B. q aus p ⊃q.p folgt, ersehen wir aus diesen beiden Sätzen selbst, aber wir können es auch s o zeigen, indem wir sie zu p⊃q.p:⊃: q verbinden und nun zeigen, dass dies
eine Tautologie ist.
6.1222 Dies wirft ein Licht auf die Frage, warum die logischen Sät- ze nicht durch die Erfahrung bestätigt werden können, ebenso wenig, wie sie durch die Erfahrung widerlegt werden können. Nicht nur muss ein Satz der Logik durch keine mögliche Er- fahrung widerlegt werden können, sondern er darf auch nicht durch eine solche bestätigt werden können.
6.1223 Nun wird klar, warum man oft fühlte, als wären die logischen Wahrheiten von uns zu f o r d e r n: Wir können sie nämlich insofern fordern, als wir eine genügende Notation fordern kön- nen.
6.1224 Es wird jetzt auch klar, warum die Logik die Lehre von den Formen und vom Schliessen genannt wurde.
6.123 Es ist klar: Die logischen Gesetze dürfen nicht selbst wieder logischen Gesetzen unterstehen.
(Es gibt nicht, wie Russell meinte, für jede Type ein ei-
150
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
genes Gesetz des Widerspruches, sondern Eines genügt, da es auf sich selbst nicht angewendet wird.)
6.1231 Das Anzeichen des logischen Satzes ist n i c h t die Allgemein- gültigkeit.
Allgemein sein, heisst ja nur: Zufälligerweise für alle Dinge gelten. Ein unverallgemeinerter Satz kann ja ebensowohl tau- tologisch sein, als ein verallgemeinerter.
6.1232 Die logische Allgemeingültigkeit könnte man wesentlich nen- nen, im Gegensatz zu jener zufälligen, etwa des Satzes alle Menschen sind sterblich. Sätze, wie Russells Axiom of redu- cibility sind nicht logische Sätze, und dies erklärt unser Ge- fühl: Dass sie, wenn wahr, so doch nur durch einen günstigen Zufall wahr sein könnten.
6.1233 Es lässt sich eine Welt denken, in der das Axiom of reducibility nicht gilt. Es ist aber klar, dass die Logik nichts mit der Frage zu schaen hat, ob unsere Welt wirklich so ist oder nicht.
6.124 Die logischen Sätze beschreiben das Gerüst der Welt, oder viel- mehr, sie stellen es dar. Sie handeln von nichts. Sie setzen voraus, dass Namen Bedeutung, und Elementarsätze Sinn ha- ben: Und dies ist ihre Verbindung mit der Welt. Es ist klar, dass es etwas über die Welt anzeigen muss, dass gewisse Ver- bindungen von Symbolenwelche wesentlich einen bestimmten Charakter habenTautologien sind. Hierin liegt das Entschei- dende. Wir sagten, manches an den Symbolen, die wir gebrau- chen, wäre willkürlich, manches nicht. In der Logik drückt nur dieses aus: Dass heisst aber, in der Logik drücken nicht w i r mit Hilfe der Zeichen aus, was wir wollen, sondern in der Logik sagt die Natur der naturnotwendigen Zeichen selbst aus: Wenn wir die logische Syntax irgend einer Zeichensprache kennen, dann sind bereits alle Sätze der Logik gegeben.
6.125 Es ist möglich, und zwar auch nach der alten Auassung der Logik, von vornherein eine Beschreibung aller wahren logi- schen Sätze zu geben.
6.1251 Darum kann es in der Logik auch n i e Überraschungen geben.
6.126 Ob ein Satz der Logik angehört, kann man berechnen, indem man die logischen Eigenschaften des S y m b o l s berechnet.
151
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
Und dies tun wir, wenn wir einen logischen Satz beweisen. Denn, ohne uns um einen Sinn und eine Bedeutung zu küm- mern, bilden wir den logischen Satz aus anderen nach blossen Z e i c h e n r e g e l n.
Der Beweis der logischen Sätze besteht darin, dass wir sie aus anderen logischen Sätzen durch successive Anwendung ge- wisser Operationen entstehen lassen, die aus den ersten immer wieder Tautologien erzeugen. (Und zwar f o l g e n aus einer Tautologie nur Tautologien.)
Natürlich ist diese Art zu zeigen, dass ihre Sätze Tautolo- gien sind, der Logik durchaus unwesentlich. Schon darum, weil die Sätze, von welchen der Beweis ausgeht, ja ohne Beweis zeigen müssen, dass sie Tautologien sind.
6.1261 In der Logik sind Prozess und Resultat äquivalent. (Darum keine Überraschung.)
6.1262 Der Beweis in der Logik ist nur ein mechanisches Hilfsmittel zum leichteren Erkennen der Tautologie, wo sie kompliziert ist.
6.1263 Es wäre ja auch zu merkwürdig, wenn man einen sinnvollen Satz l o g i s c h aus anderen beweisen könnte, und einen logi- schen Satz a u c h. Es ist von vornherein klar, dass der logische Beweis eines sinnvollen Satzes und der Beweis i n der Logik zwei ganz verschiedene Dinge sein müssen.
6.1264 Der sinnvolle Satz sagt etwas aus, und sein Beweis zeigt, dass es so ist; in der Logik ist jeder Satz die Form eines Beweises.
Jeder Satz der Logik ist ein in Zeichen dargestellter modus ponens. (Und den modus ponens kann man nicht durch einen Satz ausdrücken.)
6.1265 Immer kann man die Logik so auassen, dass jeder Satz sein eigener Beweis ist.
6.127 Alle Sätze der Logik sind gleichberechtigt, es gibt unter ihnen nicht wesentlich Grundgesetze und abgeleitete Sätze.
Jede Tautologie zeigt selbst, dass sie eine Tautologie ist.
6.1271 Es ist klar, dass die Anzahl der logischen Grundgesetze will- kürlich ist, denn man könnte die Logik ja aus Einem Grundge- setz ableiten, indem man einfach z. B. aus Freges Grundgeset-
152
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
zen das logische Produkt bildet. (Frege würde vielleicht sagen, dass dieses Grundgesetz nun nicht mehr unmittelbar einleuch- te. Aber es ist merkwürdig, dass ein so exakter Denker wie Frege sich auf den Grad des Einleuchtens als Kriterium des logischen Satzes berufen hat.)
6.13 6.2 Die Logik ist keine Lehre, sondern ein Spiegelbild der Welt.
Die Logik ist transcendental.
Die Mathematik ist eine logische Methode.
Die Sätze der Mathematik sind Gleichungen also Scheinsät-
ze.
6.21 Der Satz der Mathematik drückt keinen Gedanken aus.
6.211 Im Leben ist es ja nie der mathematische Satz, den wir brau- chen, sondern wir benützen den mathematischen Satz n u r, um aus Sätzen, welche nicht der Mathematik angehören, auf andere zu schliessen, welche gleichfalls nicht der Mathematik angehören.
(In der Philosophie führt die Frage wozu gebrauchen wir eigentlich jenes Wort, jenen Satz immer wieder zu wertvollen Einsichten.)
6.22 Die Logik der Welt, die die Sätze der Logik in den Tautologien zeigen, zeigt die Mathematik in den Gleichungen.
6.23 Wenn zwei Ausdrücke durch das Gleichheitszeichen verbunden werden, so heisst das, sie sind durch einander ersetzbar. Ob dies aber der Fall ist muss sich an den beiden Ausdrücken selbst zeigen.
Es charakterisiert die logische Form zweier Ausdrücke, dass sie durch einander ersetzbar sind.
6.231 Es ist eine Eigenschaft der Bejahung, dass man sie als doppelte Verneinung auassen kann.
Es ist eine Eigenschaft von 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, dass man es als
(1 + 1) + (1 + 1) auassen kann.
6.232 Frege sagt, die beiden Ausdrücke haben dieselbe Bedeutung, aber verschiedenen Sinn.
Das Wesentliche an der Gleichung ist aber, dass sie nicht notwendig ist, um zu zeigen, dass die beiden Ausdrücke, die
153
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
das Gleichheitszeichen verbindet, dieselbe Bedeutung haben, da sich dies aus den beiden Ausdrücken selbst ersehen lässt.
6.2321 Und, dass die Sätze der Mathematik bewiesen werden können, heisst ja nichts anderes, als dass ihre Richtigkeit einzusehen ist, ohne dass das, was sie ausdrücken, selbst mit den Tatsachen auf seine Richtigkeit hin verglichen werden muss.
6.2322 Die Identität der Bedeutung zweier Ausdrücke lässt sich nicht b e h a u p t e n. Denn um etwas von ihrer Bedeutung behaupten zu können, muss ich ihre Bedeutung kennen: und indem ich ihre Bedeutung kenne, weiss ich, ob sie dasselbe oder verschie- denes bedeuten.
6.2323 Die Gleichung kennzeichnet nur den Standpunkt, von welchem ich die beiden Ausdrücke betrachte, nämlich vom Standpunkte ihrer Bedeutungsgleichheit.
6.233 Die Frage, ob man zur Lösung der mathematischen Probleme die Anschauung brauche, muss dahin beantwortet werden, dass eben die Sprache hier die nötige Anschauung liefert.
6.2331 Der Vorgang des R e c h n e n s vermittelt eben diese Anschau- ung.
Die Rechnung ist kein Experiment.
6.234 Die Mathematik ist eine Methode der Logik.
6.2341 Das Wesentliche der mathematischen Methode ist es, mit Glei- chungen zu arbeiten. Auf dieser Methode beruht es nämlich, dass jeder Satz der Mathematik sich von selbst verstehen muss.
6.24 Die Methode der Mathematik, zu ihren Gleichungen zu kom- men, ist die Substitutionsmethode.
Denn die Gleichungen drücken die Ersetzbarkeit zweier Ausdrücke aus und wir schreiten von einer Anzahl von Gleichungen zu neuen Gleichungen vor, indem wir, den Gleichungen entsprechend, Ausdrücke durch andere ersetzen.
6.241 So lautet der Beweis des Satzes 2 ×2 = 4:
(Ων)µ′x= Ων×µ′x Def.
Ω2×2′x= (Ω2)2′x= (Ω2)1+1′x= Ω2′Ω2′x= Ω1+1′Ω1+1′x
= (Ω′Ω)′(Ω′Ω)′x= Ω′Ω′Ω′Ω′x= Ω1+1+1+1′x= Ω4′x.
154
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
6.3 Die Erforschung der Logik bedeutet die Erforschung a l l e r G e s e t z m ä s s i g k e i t. Und ausserhalb der Logik ist alles Zu- fall.
6.31 Das sogenannte Gesetz der Induktion kann jedenfalls kein lo- gisches Gesetz sein, denn es ist oenbar ein sinnvoller Satz. Und darum kann es auch kein Gesetz a priori sein.
6.32 Das Kausalitätsgesetz ist kein Gesetz, sondern die Form eines Gesetzes.
6.321 Kausalitätsgesetz, das ist ein Gattungsname. Und wie es in der Mechanik, sagen wir, Minimum-Gesetze gibt,etwa der kleinsten Wirkungso gibt es in der Physik Kausalitätsgesetze, Gesetze von der Kausalitätsform.
6.3211 Man hat ja auch davon eine Ahnung gehabt, dass es e i n Ge- setz der kleinsten Wirkung geben müsse, ehe man genau wuss- te, wie es lautete. (Hier, wie immer, stellt sich das a priori Gewisse als etwas rein Logisches heraus.)
6.33 Wir g l a u b e n nicht a priori an ein Erhaltungsgesetz, sondern wir w i s s e n a priori die Möglichkeit einer logischen Form.
6.34 Alle jene Sätze, wie der Satz vom Grunde, von der Kontinuität in der Natur, vom kleinsten Aufwande in der Natur etc. etc., alle diese sind Einsichten a priori über die mögliche Formge- bung der Sätze der Wissenschaft.
6.341 Die Newtonsche Mechanik z. B. bringt die Weltbeschreibung auf eine einheitliche Form. Denken wir uns eine weisse Flä- che, auf der unregelmässige schwarze Flecken wären. Wir sa- gen nun: Was für ein Bild immer hierdurch entsteht, immer kann ich seiner Beschreibung beliebig nahe kommen, indem ich die Fläche mit einem entsprechend feinen quadratischen Netzwerk bedecke und nun von jedem Quadrat sage, dass es weiss oder schwarz ist. Ich werde auf diese Weise die Beschrei- bung der Fläche auf eine einheitliche Form gebracht haben. Diese Form ist beliebig, denn ich hätte mit dem gleichen Er- folge ein Netz aus dreieckigen oder sechseckigen Maschen ver- wenden können. Es kann sein, dass die Beschreibung mit Hil- fe eines Dreiecks-Netzes einfacher geworden wäre; das heisst, dass wir die Fläche mit einem gröberen Dreiecks-Netz genau-
155
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
er beschreiben könnten, als mit einem feineren quadratischen (oder umgekehrt) usw. Den verschiedenen Netzen entsprechen verschiedene Systeme der Weltbeschreibung. Die Mechanik be- stimmt eine Form der Weltbeschreibung, indem sie sagt: Alle Sätze der Weltbeschreibung müssen aus einer Anzahl gegebe- ner Sätzeden mechanischen Axiomenauf eine gegebene Art und Weise erhalten werden. Hierdurch liefert sie die Bausteine zum Bau des wissenschaftlichen Gebäudes und sagt: Welches Gebäude immer du auühren willst, jedes musst du irgendwie mit diesen und nur diesen Bausteinen zusammenbringen.
(Wie man mit dem Zahlensystem jede beliebige Anzahl, so muss man mit dem System der Mechanik jeden beliebigen Satz der Physik hinschreiben können.)
6.342 Und nun sehen wir die gegenseitige Stellung von Logik und Mechanik. (Man könnte das Netz auch aus verschiedenartigen Figuren etwa aus Dreiecken und Sechsecken bestehen lassen.) Dass sich ein Bild, wie das vorhin erwähnte, durch ein Netz von gegebener Form beschreiben lässt, sagt über das Bild n i c h t s aus. (Denn dies gilt für jedes Bild dieser Art.) D a s aber charakterisiert das Bild, dass es sich durch ein bestimmtes Netz von b e s t i m m t e r Feinheit v o l l s t ä n d i g beschreiben lässt.
So auch sagt es nichts über die Welt aus, dass sie sich durch die Newtonsche Mechanik beschreiben lässt; wohl aber, dass sie sich s o durch jene beschreiben lässt, wie dies eben der Fall ist. Auch das sagt etwas über die Welt, dass sie sich durch die eine Mechanik einfacher beschreiben lässt, als durch die andere.
6.343 Die Mechanik ist ein Versuch, alle w a h r e n Sätze, die wir zur Weltbeschreibung brauchen, nach Einem Plane zu konstruie- ren.
6.3431 Durch den ganzen logischen Apparat hindurch sprechen die physikalischen Gesetze doch von den Gegenständen der Welt.
6.3432 Wir dürfen nicht vergessen, dass die Weltbeschreibung durch die Mechanik immer die ganz allgemeine ist. Es ist in ihr z. B. nie von b e s t i m m t e n materiellen Punkten die Rede, sondern immer nur von i r g e n d w e l c h e n.
6.35 Obwohl die Flecke in unserem Bild geometrische Figuren sind,
156
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
so kann doch selbstverständlich die Geometrie gar nichts über ihre tatsächliche Form und Lage sagen. Das Netz aber ist r e i n geometrisch, alle seine Eigenschaften können a priori angegeben werden.
Gesetze, wie der Satz vom Grunde, etc., handeln vom Netz, nicht von dem, was das Netz beschreibt.
6.36 Wenn es ein Kausalitätsgesetz gäbe, so könnte es lauten: Es gibt Naturgesetze.
Aber freilich kann man das nicht sagen: es zeigt sich.
6.361 In der Ausdrucksweise Hertz's könnte man sagen: Nur g e - s e t z m ä s s i g e Zusammenhänge sind d e n k b a r.
6.3611 Wir können keinen Vorgang mit dem Ablauf der Zeit verglei- chendiesen gibt es nicht, sondern nur mit einem anderen Vorgang (etwa mit dem Gang des Chronometers).
Daher ist die Beschreibung des zeitlichen Verlaufs nur so möglich, dass wir uns auf einen anderen Vorgang stützen.
Ganz Analoges gilt für den Raum. Wo man z. B. sagt, es könne keines von zwei Ereignissen (die sich gegenseitig aus- schliessen) eintreten, weil k e i n e U r s a c h e vorhanden sei, warum das eine eher als das andere eintreten solle, da han- delt es sich in Wirklichkeit darum, dass man gar nicht e i n e s der beiden Ereignisse beschreiben kann, wenn nicht irgend eine Asymmetrie vorhanden ist. Und w e n n eine solche Asymmetrie vorhanden i s t, so können wir diese als U r s a c h e des Eintref- fens des einen und Nicht-Eintreens des anderen auassen.
6.36111 Das Kant'sche Problem von der rechten und linken Hand, die man nicht zur Deckung bringen kann, besteht schon in der Ebe- ne, ja im eindimensionalen Raum, wo die beiden kongruenten Figuren a und b auch nicht zur Deckung gebracht werden kön- nen, ohne aus diesem Raum herausbewegt zu werden. Rechte und linke Hand sind tatsächlich vollkommen kongruent. Und dass man sie nicht zur Deckung bringen kann, hat damit nichts zu tun.
Den rechten Handschuh könnte man an die linke Hand

ziehen, wenn man ihn im vierdimensionalen Raum umdrehen könnte.
6.362 Was sich beschreiben lässt, das kann auch geschehen, und was das Kausalitätsgesetz ausschliessen soll, das lässt sich auch nicht beschreiben.
6.363 Der Vorgang der Induktion besteht darin, dass wir das e i n - f a c h s t e Gesetz annehmen, das mit unseren Erfahrungen in Einklang zu bringen ist.
6.3631 Dieser Vorgang hat aber keine logische, sondern nur eine psy- chologische Begründung.
Es ist klar, dass kein Grund vorhanden ist, zu glauben, es werde nun auch wirklich der einfachste Fall eintreten.
6.36311 Dass die Sonne morgen aufgehen wird, ist eine Hypothese; und das heisst: wir w i s s e n nicht, ob sie aufgehen wird.
6.37 Einen Zwang, nach dem Eines geschehen müsste, weil etwas anderes geschehen ist, gibt es nicht. Es gibt nur eine l o g i - s c h e Notwendigkeit.
6.371 Der ganzen modernen Weltanschauung liegt die Täuschung zu- grunde, dass die sogenannten Naturgesetze die Erklärungen der Naturerscheinungen seien.
6.372 So bleiben sie bei den Naturgesetzen als bei etwas Unantast- barem stehen, wie die älteren bei Gott und dem Schicksal.
Und sie haben ja beide Recht, und Unrecht. Die Alten sind allerdings insofern klarer, als sie einen klaren Abschluss anerkennen, während es bei dem neuen System scheinen soll, als sei a l l e s erklärt.
6.373 Die Welt ist unabhängig von meinem Willen.
6.374 Auch wenn alles, was wir wünschen, geschähe, so wäre dies doch nur, sozusagen, eine Gnade des Schicksals, denn es ist kein l o g i s c h e r Zusammenhang zwischen Willen und Welt, der dies verbürgte, und den angenommenen physikalischen Zu- sammenhang könnten wir doch nicht selbst wieder wollen.
6.375 Wie es nur eine l o g i s c h e Notwendigkeit gibt, so gibt es auch nur eine l o g i s c h e Unmöglichkeit.

6.3751 Dass z. B. zwei Farben zugleich an einem Ort des Gesichtsfel- des sind, ist unmöglich und zwar logisch unmöglich, denn es ist durch die logische Struktur der Farbe ausgeschlossen.
Denken wir daran, wie sich dieser Widerspruch in der Phy- sik darstellt: Ungefähr so, dass ein Teilchen nicht zu gleicher Zeit zwei Geschwindigkeiten haben kann; das heisst, dass es nicht zu gleicher Zeit an zwei Orten sein kann; das heisst, dass Teilchen an verschiedenen Orten zu Einer Zeit nicht identisch sein können.
(Es ist klar, dass das logische Produkt zweier Elementar- sätze weder eine Tautologie noch eine Kontradiktion sein kann. Die Aussage, dass ein Punkt des Gesichtsfeldes zu gleicher Zeit zwei verschiedene Farben hat, ist eine Kontradiktion.)
6.4 Alle Sätze sind gleichwertig.
6.41 Der Sinn der Welt muss ausserhalb ihrer liegen. In der Welt ist alles wie es ist und geschieht alles wie es geschieht; es gibt i n ihr keinen Wertund wenn es ihn gäbe, so hätte er keinen Wert.
Wenn es einen Wert gibt, der Wert hat, so muss er ausser- halb alles Geschehens und So-Seins liegen. Denn alles Gesche- hen und So-Sein ist zufällig.
Was es nicht-zufällig macht, kann nicht i n der Welt liegen, denn sonst wäre dies wieder zufällig.
Es muss ausserhalb der Welt liegen.
6.42 Darum kann es auch keine Sätze der Ethik geben.
Sätze können nichts Höheres ausdrücken.
6.421 Es ist klar, dass sich die Ethik nicht aussprechen lässt.
Die Ethik ist transcendental.
(Ethik und Aesthetik sind Eins.)
6.422 Der erste Gedanke bei der Aufstellung eines ethischen Gesetzes von der Form du sollst .... ist: Und was dann, wenn ich es nicht tue? Es ist aber klar, dass die Ethik nichts mit Strafe und Lohn im gewöhnlichen Sinne zu tun hat. Also muss diese Frage nach den Fo l g e n einer Handlung belanglos sein.Zum Mindesten dürfen diese Folgen nicht Ereignisse sein. Denn et- was muss doch an jener Fragestellung richtig sein. Es muss
159
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
zwar eine Art von ethischem Lohn und ethischer Strafe geben, aber diese müssen in der Handlung selbst liegen.
(Und das ist auch klar, dass der Lohn etwas Angenehmes, die Strafe etwas Unangenehmes sein muss.)
6.423 Vom Willen als dem Träger des Ethischen kann nicht gespro- chen werden.
Und der Wille als Phänomen interessiert nur die Psycholo-
gie.
6.43 Wenn das gute oder böse Wollen die Welt ändert, so kann es nur die Grenzen der Welt ändern, nicht die Tatsachen; nicht das, was durch die Sprache ausgedrückt werden kann.
Kurz, die Welt muss dann dadurch überhaupt eine andere werden. Sie muss sozusagen als Ganzes abnehmen oder zuneh- men.
Die Welt des Glücklichen ist eine andere als die des Un- glücklichen.
6.431 Wie auch beim Tod die Welt sich nicht ändert, sondern auf- hört.
6.4311 Der Tod ist kein Ereignis des Lebens. Den Tod erlebt man nicht.
Wenn man unter Ewigkeit nicht unendliche Zeitdauer, son- dern Unzeitlichkeit versteht, dann lebt der ewig, der in der Gegenwart lebt.
Unser Leben ist ebenso endlos, wie unser Gesichtsfeld gren- zenlos ist.
6.4312 Die zeitliche Unsterblichkeit der Seele des Menschen, das heisst also ihr ewiges Fortleben auch nach dem Tode, ist nicht nur auf keine Weise verbürgt, sondern vor allem leistet diese Annahme gar nicht das, was man immer mit ihr erreichen wollte. Wird denn dadurch ein Rätsel gelöst, dass ich ewig fortlebe? Ist denn dieses ewige Leben dann nicht ebenso rätselhaft wie das gegenwärtige? Die Lösung des Rätsels des Lebens in Raum und Zeit liegt a u s s e r h a l b von Raum und Zeit.
(Nicht Probleme der Naturwissenschaft sind ja zu lösen.)
6.432 W i e die Welt ist, ist für das Höhere vollkommen gleichgültig. Gott oenbart sich nicht i n der Welt.
160
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
6.4321 Die Tatsachen gehören alle nur zur Aufgabe, nicht zur Lösung.
6.44 Nicht w i e die Welt ist, ist das Mystische, sondern d a s s sie ist.
6.45 Die Anschauung der Welt sub specie aeterni ist ihre Anschau- ung alsbegrenztesGanzes.
Das Gefühl der Welt als begrenztes Ganzes ist das mysti- sche.
6.5 Zu einer Antwort, die man nicht aussprechen kann, kann man auch die Frage nicht aussprechen.
D a s R ä t s e l gibt es nicht.
Wenn sich eine Frage überhaupt stellen lässt, so ka n n sie auch beantwortet werden.
6.51 Skeptizismus ist n i c h t unwiderleglich, sondern oenbar unsin- nig, wenn er bezweifeln will, wo nicht gefragt werden kann.
Denn Zweifel kann nur bestehen, wo eine Frage besteht; eine Frage nur, wo eine Antwort besteht, und diese nur, wo etwas g e s a g t werden ka n n.
6.52 Wir fühlen, dass selbst, wenn alle m ö g l i c h e n wissenschaft- lichen Fragen beantwortet sind, unsere Lebensprobleme noch gar nicht berührt sind. Freilich bleibt dann eben keine Frage mehr; und eben dies ist die Antwort.
6.521 Die Lösung des Problems des Lebens merkt man am Ver- schwinden dieses Problems.
(Ist nicht dies der Grund, warum Menschen, denen der Sinn des Lebens nach langen Zweifeln klar wurde, warum diese dann nicht sagen konnten, worin dieser Sinn bestand.)
6.522 Es gibt allerdings Unaussprechliches. Dies z e i g t sich, es ist das Mystische.
6.53 Die richtige Methode der Philosophie wäre eigentlich die: Nichts zu sagen, als was sich sagen lässt, also Sätze der Naturwissenschaftalso etwas, was mit Philosophie nichts zu tun hat, und dann immer, wenn ein anderer etwas Metaphysisches sagen wollte, ihm nachzuweisen, dass er gewissen Zeichen in seinen Sätzen keine Bedeutung gegeben hat. Diese Methode wäre für den anderen unbefriedigender
161
LOGISCH-PHILOSOPHISCHE ABHANDLUNG
hätte nicht das Gefühl, dass wir ihn Philosophie lehrtenaber s i e wäre die einzig streng richtige.
6.54 Meine Sätze erläutern dadurch, dass sie der, welcher mich ver- steht, am Ende als unsinnig erkennt, wenn er durch sieauf ihnenüber sie hinausgestiegen ist. (Er muss sozusagen die Leiter wegwerfen, nachdem er auf ihr hinaufgestiegen ist.)
Er muss diese Sätze überwinden, dann sieht er die Welt richtig.
7 Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen.
